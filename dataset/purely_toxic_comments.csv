After having a stressful game on League THIS is EXACTLY what i needed to see!
retarded posts. even if its a mod free joke u should post league related stuff. And people actually upvoting this are retards who will make mod free weeks in the future impossible
"Well, we had a chance to prove to the mods that we don't need them. Glad we wasted this chance. You people are retards. "
Why the hell do people upvote bread... just goes to show /r/leagueoflegends humor
"While I don't have much of a refined taste for bread, I do quite like the one you can make at home with the bread-making machine. It's not complicated, throw in ingredients and it does all the work, but damn is it tasty."
"Way to go man.

Quality post, you goddamn oxygen thief!"
As someone with Celiac disease I AM SO TRIGGERED right now. Damn gluten eating shitlords...
"I don't care what it is, it has been posted to /r/new multiple times in the past 30 minutes. Ergo, it's spam. "
It could be a picture of 'spam' (the food stuff) for all I care. It has been posted 11 times in the past 30 minutes. That is 'spam' (the action of spamming) and still against the rules.  
"Hey man, no need to be rude. We're all fellow bread enthusiasts"
"Ever since the mods went on a personal vendetta against Richard Lewis, did nothing about known vote manipulation, colluded in allowing WTFast content that demonstrated the bad practices of the program and the company to be taken down at requests of streamers who advertised it *and* pull up a new set of draconian laws from the introduction page of ""an idiot's guide to law""? 

Yeah, I think the community might have a right to be more than a little annoyed at the mods atm."
Normally I always hate these jokes with Zed's quotes but that one is really good lmao (all in the row above me +1 to you)
"Lewis started it and deserved it.

>did nothing about known vote manipulation

lolwut

>pull up a new set of draconian laws from the introduction page of ""an idiot's guide to law

Yeah good thing the community actually had a good discussion with them about it... oh wait.  lol sorry they just downvoted the mods regardless of what the mods said and then spammed them with all kinds of terrible things.  "
"Lewis didn't start shit. He was a dick to people, sure, but this vendetta is here only because mods want to control what is posted in this subreddit. When they coerced him into cooperation or your shit will be deleted, what was he supposed to do? He just wanted mods to be accountable so he ""doxxed"" them (by doing a fucking google search...) and planned to write article about them, but of course mod fanboys started to cry a lot."
"Well, no. There's actually a video he released that catalogues the events, but seeing as his content was banned from the subreddit it didn't get much exposure here. In nay case, the mods entire argument hinged on ""brigading"", which is kind of dumb. Can you really criticise someone for the actions of his followers who go to see his content on the subreddit? He didn't ask them to go and he didn't ask them to vote, they made that decision by themselves. By the very words of the ""brigading"" rule, that isn't brigading. That's just people on the internet going and looking at things their favourite content creator made. Which is ironic as it brings us onto the next point

Vote manipulation, as in the Skype group where content creators would vote up each others content to manipulate Reddits visibility algorithm. New submissions are made more visible in the ""rising"" and ""hot"" tabs based on how many votes they get in a short period of time. This is hilarious because it's actual **provable** brigading, but the mods did nothing about it. Pure and simple. They interpreted the rules how they wished and used them to push a personal agenda.

You're right, they were downvoted to hell because anybody who is older than 14 can see how bad those rules actually were. I mean, most responded like you did. Case and point:

>lolwut

I mean, that was eloquent as *fuck*. But thankfully, the [top comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/34zvn6/rules_rework_draft_discussion/) laid out the issues far more coherently than most of the nerd rage in there.

Do you really expect people to just go ""sure mods, whatever you say sir"" and not lash back at the mods who treat people like they're tweens?"
"Dude, what on earth.  You think the mods just randomly started hating on THAT GUY IN PARTICULAR?  Pfft, no.  He had issues with them and posted all kinds of libelous drivel before threatening to post personal information."
"I have not seen a single legitimate account that had Lewis not starting it rofl.  And I highly doubt that the mods just randomly started picking on poor little lewis.

Oh, sorry, I didn't think that such an idiotic statement deserved anything more eloquent rofl.  That's my response to you believing that the mods did absolutely nothing about that.

And those top comments were, well, the follow up comments laid out why they were dumb more coherently than most of the nerds raging about how bad the rules are."
"No, bend then knee was when he was approached by moderators to work with them on the content posted here. He had to personally show them video/article BEFORE it was posted here, they had to okay it, and then he could post it here. That was the reason he was so pissed."
"Since the downvote bots have hit the post I'll compile some of the Riot replies to common questions here for the sake of visibility:

- *""Any word on fixing the conflict with MSI Afterburner?""*  
[""Yeah, started the process of reaching out to MSi so we can work together to get it fixed. We did see similar issues on VAL launch that were self-serviced, but we'd like to get it fixed as quickly as possible.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1civ4l7/update_from_riot_on_vanguard/l2c2o1s/?context=3)
- Regarding screenshot functionality of Vanguard:  
[""The screenshot functionality is not enabled for League of Legends, and it is only used today in VALORANT. If we do ever use it, it would be the actual game client, League of Legends.exe, and the goal would be spotting scripting overlays or zoomhacks.  
However, we're not certain this will ever be necessary, as the FoW in LoL is very unforgiving, and your client rarely has information on units you shouldn't see. The impact of a purely vision-based cheat is too minimal, but we'll have to see how cheaters adapt.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1civ4l7/update_from_riot_on_vanguard/l2caev9/?context=3)
- *""Is the roll out of this compliant in the EU? What differs in the US?""*  
[""Yep, fully. We're compliant with the regional privacy laws of the countries we service.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1civ4l7/update_from_riot_on_vanguard/l2bs5ib/?context=3)  
*""What differs about vanguard in the EU vs US?""*  
[""There aren't any differences, we still reach compliance with privacy laws even in areas they aren't mandated, so the US still has the stringency of the European and other regional privacy laws.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1civ4l7/update_from_riot_on_vanguard/l2bsrht/?context=3)
- *""Can Riot Vanguard ban me if League/Riot Client is not running and I am modding another game?""*  
[""We only look to ban for tools that are actively tampering in League of Legends in a malicious and unauthorized manner. I can't ensure that some of these tools won't have random hooks into the game, but if they're closed, you should be ok.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1civ4l7/update_from_riot_on_vanguard/l2c3m6y/?context=3)
- *""a friend wanted to ask if certain VMs were going to whitelisted like Nvidia Now, since I know a lot are being used to run bots""*  
[We don't want Vanguard in a VM, because live analysis of it then becomes too easy. The problem with allowlisting specific VMs is that our driver doesn't have any connectivity when it loads. We can't contact any service (or check against a known GFN IP range) before Vanguard starts to reveal the magic. Any VM checks to the hardware would have to be local, and that's something that's a little to easy to beat.  
But we're still thinking on it, and we have a few ideas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1civ4l7/update_from_riot_on_vanguard/l2cjxki/?context=3)
- *""Say, I don't have TPM physically in my PC. But in the light of the soon discontinuity of Windows 10 support, I upgraded it to Windows 11 bypassing the TPM requirement. So, to be able playing LoL, I now have to downgrade to Windows 10 and use unsupported system or literally just buy a new PC?""*  
[""It is required to have TPM 2.0 enabled on Windows 11.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1civ4l7/update_from_riot_on_vanguard/l2bu6kr/?context=3)

[""The blog has some insight into the “always on” aspect under the “Why is it always on?” section, but your comfort with trusting Riot to operate at the kernel level is your choice.  
Having a kernel mode solution wasn’t a lightly taken decision. With the implementation of our user mode Packman solution in 2018, we had already seen a large chunk of the industry move over to kernel mode drivers. While it did have initial effectiveness, along with server-sided detections, we needed more device trust in order to ensure security. It enables us to keep a more secure environment, without needing to exfiltrate excessive data to try to make detections in post.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1civ4l7/update_from_riot_on_vanguard/l2co1bi/?context=3)
- *""Why not draw the barrier around ranked?  
A sizeable population never touches ranked or even exclusively plays ARAM and mostly doesn't care about the few scripters in those modes.  
I also think that the excuses around TFT are extremely weak as it is almost trivial to bot for TFT rewards even through vanguard. Furthermore there are little to no avenues of scripting for TFT and no scripts have been known so far.""*  
[""One of the glaring issues with cheats (and bots) is that they'll go wherever we're not protected, so our requiring it in SR only would quickly plague other modes. Queue-specific and region-specific strategies were deeply considered but eventually ruled untenable.

"I want to thank everyone involved for getting vanguard into  league, it finally made me quit."
"Just to raise awareness, if I close vanguard before closing the riot client it causes a bluescreen 100% of the time. Both launch on startup, and its really not the end of the world, but it is an annoyance."
"Vanguard disables my laptop touchscreen driver 😢 I just sent in a ticket, but from Googling it looks like another person with this problem just got ignored...

edit: I use the touchscreen for work, not for League, but it's troublesome to have to disable Vanguard/restart when I want to use the touchscreen and then do the opposite when I want to play League =o="
Can we just have a tft-exclusive launcher for Pc without Vanguard? I dont play LoL anymore and dont want Vanguard on my pc.
"funny, that not the toxic shit community made me uninstall LoL but actually RIOT itself with that vanguard shit 

guess maybe I will really try dota. I will miss some of the fav characters from LoL and to this day I'm sad that Diana didn't got fanservice skins (specially Pool Party of Star Guardian) but I'm not gonna let RIOT/Tencent install some bullshit on my PC. **I wish they let play at least ARAM (and TFT) without having to install Vanguard**

it's so weird that they care more about spripters and botters than actually toxic shit people that ruin more games even outside of high elo ranked games (where most people probably use scripts/bots)"
"After installing Vanguard, my PC started taking forever to boot.

Only after disabling Vanguard on startup, was it fixed.

I'm wondering if you know of this issue?"
"Does disabling vanguard from startup in task manager works or it only hides the vanguard system tray (vanguard driver is still running)? I don't play league of legends as much (2 days a week at most), so I am a bit reluctant to having it turn on all the time."
"I have been playing League since Beta, reached rank 221, and have spent over $3000 over the years. 

I love the game and don't want to quit, but I have uninstalled League of Legends because of Vanguard. 

Please Riot, find a different way."
"Just a small question :


When Vanguard was announced, we got a fancy animationnon screen saying Vanguard detected a cheater, ect ect,


Is there such similar feature right now? Can a game be stopped live?
Or is vanguard just preventing games to be launched and/or detecting and banning cheaters only afterwards a game has ended?


Thank you for your transparency as a whole!"
"Perhaps this is a weird question, but I've been doing funny Twitch streams and YouTube videos where I've played League with some custom programs I've written with Python using the keyboard library for example. Those programs usually perform some kind of mouse button or keyboard button press.

For example, I've once played League of Legends using a flute to move my mouse and champion. Those programs do not inject themselves into the game, do not read any RAM or even do any screen capture or things like that. It's stupidly clicking on predefinied coordinates on the screen.

Now that Vanguard is introduced to League, how safe is it for me to continue doing this? Is there any risk of me getting banned for ""cheating"", even though I'm not getting any information from the game or do anything malicious at all?

Thanks for the answer!"
"Hey K3o. Yall claim that vanguard isnt interacting in ring-2 but we also know the drivers are loading at least at that stage in the boot cycle if not loading in management engine. Can you provide the documentation of your boot level drivers to show they aren't interfacing with APIC to trigger an interrupt during SMM? Because otherwise all we really have to go on is your statement that ""no really thats not how our software works except it totally could"" to explain a lot of folks being unable to boot after installing your software. You don't need to expose your whole engine but realistically you guys have generated a LOT of bad press with this decision to move forward and its repercussions and a bit of transparency at least into your system drivers would help a lot..."
"Don't you think its a failure that players need to troubleshoot themselves the problems of the anticheat? Ive seen people claim they needed to go into the fucking BIOS to make Vanguards work, some people are not good with this stuff and its a nightmare to go through just to play a videogame.

This is the type of goofy pcgaming event you'd expect when you try to make MaxPayne1 work"
"My PC is completely shutted Down. When I reached to support, they asked for logs. HOW CAN I SEND THE LOGS WHEN YOU DESTROYED MY PC??? I responded calmly that i can't, explained one more time. Since then, no respond. My PC is dead cause of Vanguard."
"It looks like the concerns were right, it took one whole day for a massive bug to stop people being able to play.  

I'm getting the windows cannot access the specified path error.  Tried all the fixes on riot website. 

Turns out the player base's lack of faith in riot being able to roll this out and run it without issue was 100% founded, but I don't think even the biggest critics expected it to take just 1 day to collapse."
"So, I guess I just never play anymore because of TPM 2.0 requirement and I'm not in the position to pay for upgrades.  Thanks Riot"
"Seeing riot replies here in the comments so figured i'd drop it here.

since installing vanguard, anytime it's open and i try playing honkai star rail it will have complete multi second lock ups nonstop, i close vanguard and it goes away. reboot pc so vanguard is back and it happens again, 100% consistently. Any idea why? Or am i only allowed to play games by riot on my pc? Annoying enough closing it each time that i just don't wanna be bothered with league anymore, lots more out there i can play that doesn't screw up my system."
"> About ~0.7% of the playerbase bypassed Microsoft’s enforcement for TPM 2.0 when they installed Windows 11

Although 0.7% might seem small, we are talking about a game with a large player base. Releasing this update, fully aware that it will shave off this percentage and not caring one bit, is extremely worrisome.

> fewer than 0.03% of players have reported issues with Vanguard

Also guarantee that this is untrue, especially when there are so many players posting daily about Vanguard issues on the Valorant tech support subreddit."
"Really sucks. I only play TFT now and late night ARAM was always a blast when my friends and I could get on at the same time. Now I don’t get to play TFT or game with my friends, because this is absurd. Whole online friend group, but 1, has uninstalled. Shame on you, Riot. I don’t expect a lot, but this is a big shame."
You can shove that CCP's sleeper spy software up Xi's ass
"I've tried multiple reinstalls and cannot play league anymore. Vanguard always fails, and i submitted a ticket only for the support website to say i have no open tickets after submission"
"that seems like a pretty misleading statistic-- "".03% of players have reported an issue with Vanguard.""   
  
 I've had 3 errors in the last week, and two friends have had them too out of my ten or so that play League. I do not believe we are an absurd statistical anomally. Do you not have data on what percent of accounts experience a Vanguard error?



If you meant "".03% filled out a ticket request for it out of the millions that play,"" well, yeah, most people frankly aren't gonna bother."
when will we get a Riot Dev post about how vanguard is doing and all the stats?
Ever since the update I'm having insane stutters fps drops that makes the game unplayable. Fix your shit before rolling it! Your support doesn't  even reply
I think assuming there are close to no problems with vanguard based on the fact that you don't receive many reports is pretty bad logic imo. A lot of people just decline to issue tickets at this point since your support is run by bots and players can rarely get any help anyway. I personally had multiple crashes since the vanguard was introduced but didn't bother to contact support since I know you won't resolve this issue
"Newer player here,  this all seems wack. Quit playing valorant because of vanguard. Now I'm done with league too I guess. Kind of a shame was really learning to like the game"
"Great update, My game stutters like crazy and I can't play.
Thank you for making me and my friends (that are also having problems with league) finally quit the game.
We have been playing since season 2, goodbye."
"What a surprise, nobody wants Vanguard, even the people affected by cheaters and bots in the game"
Can you make it stop blocking elements of System 32? It's so incredibly terrible that I get that pop up on a daily basis.
"Yeah no, fuck all that, fuck riot and fuck vanguard"
So riot is just blatantly lying on main now? Or are you calling LS a liar?
Vanguard is great! It made me quit League for good.
">No confirmed instances of vanguard bricking peoples computers

Is this not just survivorship bias? ""We didnt brick, you just have to mess with your BIOS!"" seems incredibly disingenuous. For anyone who isnt tech savvy this is a nightmare and for anyone who doesnt have another form of online connection, ie cell phone, laptop etc, how are they supposed to know how to resolve this problem themselves? Seems almost necessary for vanguard to include some kind of bail out so that it just fails rather than stopping the pc from turning on."
I feel like Vanguard will be the death of league or least make it less popular. Sadly I had to quit playing since I dont have TPM 2.0.  Guess this is for the best time to move on.
"Vanguard was never required for a start, stop saying it like it is actually mandatory to run a kernel level anti cheat because you can't handle the cheaters via team management, I played league for at least 10 years and now I'm really frustrated, you can actually hear the community and fix/revamp the client for once to ease the access and not doing potential root system software to your players who never asked for it"
"Can Riot Vanguard ban me if League/Riot Client is not running and I am modding another game?

I sometimes hang in a call with friends while playing my own modded games, and join in when they ask for a game. Having me restart to reenable Riot Vanguard makes the joining in part a lot more tedious, and I don't really want to get banned for something I do to another game."
"Crash simulator 2024. I have process explorer open and the moment the game launches, it crashes without giving an option to report anything. Infinitely needing to reconnect. I'm on Windows 10. I don't have an MSI card. I closed Overwolf and MOBAlytics. I don't know what to do to fix this issue so I can play with my friends."
I’m disappointed vanguard was rolled out for League and it’s the reason I won’t be returning to the game. It’s far too invasive and completely unnecessary.
"As someone who has uninstalled over this, the simple fact is using Vanguard has nothing to do with trusting Riot or not. 

You are implementing always-on ring 0 access to tens (or even hundreds) of millions of systems. It is fundamentally impossible for a commercial entity like Riot to stop major state actors and their technological equivalents from weaponizing Vanguard in ways that you can't possibly predict.

This isn't just a threat to the individual. On the admittedly paranoid end of the scale, the potential establishment of clandestine botnets unknowingly powered by Vanguard could be a risk to virtually everyone including major corporations, NGOs, and governments.

While I'm sure my comment will change nothing, it certainly needs to be said."
"riot:

>*we have not confirmed any instances of Vanguard bricking anyone’s hardware*

well, considering that it's a game that's the bare minium...

also riot:

\*admit that they bricked people pc\*:

>*enabling SecureBoot would prevent your GPU from rendering anything(since it won’t boot), resulting in a black screen. There would be twoways to fix this:* ***Connect the monitor to an integrated graphics card (ifyou have one)***

so basically they say that they bricked people pc and **the user is required to buy a new vga monitor to fix the mess.**

or this doesn't count because technically is the player who did that to follow their no-sense requirements?

of course you don't have reports of bricked pc, how the guy with bricked pc is going to report it?

riot:

>*To be very clear, Vanguard DOES NOT take a screenshot of your whole computer/multiple monitors.*

but they take a snapshot (copy) of your RAM which might contain your passwords, documents, images.... they admit doing so in their post where they say that ""the snapshot might contain PII"" (personally identifiable informations)"
"It's just a video game and it's being treated as some highly sensitive government software. As if cheaters haven't existen since day ONE, but only 16 years later they become that much of a problem? 🤔

And Riot will again chunk out the ""There are alot of cheaters in high ranks""... But guess what? The majority of players ARE NOT in the high ranks and DO NOT CARE! I am a casual player and take this game as seriously as online chess. 

Fuck seriousness and fuck all this ""Be a pro, grind, train to be like Faker"" military propaganda that all these pro events chunk out every year! Some of us just want to play for fun. Hell forbid anyone does that anymore!

I'm glad I still have HOTS installed. That game will definitely be gracing my screen more."
"I returned to LOL after 5 years. Have a lot of fond memories playing the game with friends. And I gotta admit, for the 2 weeks I played LOL again, the game was very good. Jungling was very fun and I love how you reworked my main champ Skarner.

But that's not worth the sacrifice of privacy that you demand. I value my privacy too much. 

And there are many other games that use much less intrusive anti-cheating software. And they manage to keep down the number of cheaters fairly well.

 You'll always have cheaters in games, that's a fact of life. Only way you'll ever completely eliminate cheating is by ceasing operations of the game. I much rather keep my privacy and have a bad game against some cheater once in a while, than to install chinese kernel spyware

And I know, you don't need my money, you're swimming in cash from all your Ahri and Lux skins.

But, it's been fun. I still thank Riot for all the memories and for creating a good compelling world. Your lore and world building is awesome. But, I'm not gonna relinquish my privacy 

So I'll be off to play other games"
"Truthfully, I think you should give the option that if you don’t have Riot Vanguard you can play anything except ranked modes.

I would rather play a normal quick play or a Normal Draft with all the cheaters in the lobby than play a Ranked game and have you scrape all my personal data."
Get rid of this disgusting spyware you chinese overlord owned dogs
I will not be playing league until this shit doesnt auto-start.....disgusting
can’t wait to see this shit talked about in a ‘downfall of league’ video in 2 years max
"I do appreciate the updates and I've always defended Riot as a company that tries to do its best for the game and the community. People get emotional about games they love, but I think even when people are angry Riot does a good job of explaining their reasoning behind changes and listening to the community. I understand the reasoning behind Vanguard and why it needs to be extensive if it's going to be blocking cheaters.

With that said, as someone who's played league for years, these I pretty much just play ARAM and the rotating game modes and some occasional low level non ranked rift games. Having a bot in 3.5% of my ARAM games still doesn't seem like enough reason to have to install a kernel level anti cheat program. For that reason I'm out. If Riot ever takes away the Vanguard requirement for ARAM and rotating games mode I would happily install again and keep buying skins."
"So you are telling us that everyone that reported their PCs crashing, lagging and bugging with screenshots and everything are lying??

What a bunch of pathetic and incompetent losers you rioters are... A shame that your department wasn't the one hit by the mass layoffs"
"I just installed vanguard, the client prompted me to restart my pc and now my pc will not start back up. GPU clicks on and lights up for a split second then goes back off. Have tried 6-7 times now over the last 10 minutes. Not once have I ever gad an issue with my pc starting/restarting. Here's your first evidence of hardware bricking I guess...


Update: I was able to get my PC to start again by following what LS said worked for him on twitter - resetting my CMOS battery in my motherboard. He said he had to change some boot settings, I didn't bother and instead uninstalled vanguard where it will remain for the forseeable future. For the dumbass higher in this thread saying he was disparaging vanguard for clicks and engagement, I can confirm he is not."
this is just your team finding more flaws that you anticipated and looking for the receipts so we do the work for you.* Vanguard running 24/7 is the worst privacy violation since Mcafee. Edit spelling*
"Vanguard stole 23 LP from me today.

Vanguard running, game said it wasn't, wouldn't let me play, leavebustered. ticketID: 100986935 

Title. The game just screwed me out of 23LP for no reason, Vanguard has been running since yesterday when I patched and I already played four games with it turned on. Today it randomly said ""Vanguard must be running to play League"" and I couldn't reconnect, my team voted to remake, and I lost LP and got a penalty. Give me back my LP and remove the penalty, thanks."
"Completely invasive software that is forced to run 24/7 unless the user is aware is an absolute joke.

Absolutely disgusting."
"Yeah sorry RITO, you can put as nice a spin on this as you like. Fact remains DMA cheats are always going to bypass Vanguard and it's only a matter of time until they figure them out for LoL (they already exist in Vanguard and run undetected) all you've done is slightly raised the barrier of entry to cheaters.

I'm ok with kernel level anti-cheat systems although most of the existing ones aren't true Ring0 but requiring it to run on boot is WAY too much of a security risk to my system and network. All you have done with Vanguard is make it a juicier target for someone to try and exploit by giving it a massive install base for someone to put their attention on. You guys have been breached once, only a matter of time until it happens again."
"I know the stance on custom skins is ""we prefer you don't"" and some people are successfully using them with vanguard is running, so here's my question;

If someone were to get banned by vanguard, is it confirmable if it was due to a custom skin, and if so, is it something riot would revert or should custom skins just be use at our own risk and not something we should be using at all?

I remember riot used to have a strong stance on map skins banning them entirely, but there's been a few map skins popping up the past few years seemingly ignored."
"So, you will tell a literall child that is lets say 12 years old to tamper with the hardware of their PC, remove CMOS and basically fix your issue for you, or pay money to get someone to do it for them, or they are cooked.  
With the screenshots, there already have been reports of these going outside of EU servers, as this is the case I cannot trust anything until a complete report from a third party software audit independent company been released.   
Third is, that if someone would use hardware for botting, you would ban the HW ID, and the person would be to sell it on the second hand marketplace, the new owner will be automatically banned as well, even tho not doing anything wrong.  
The fact is, that you ""bricked"" 2 PCs that LS has, which is a known figure in League of Legends, and had him go on a wild goose hunt for the solution while not being able to provide one.   
While I understand that you want to get the game free of cheaters, this will never happen, and you loose trust of the community the same way BSG did.  
What you did, was create one of the biggest spy networks, in private hands with no oversight, and now you can deploy anything and everything from any network the PCs are connected to and running. This should be a cause for national security concerns regarding the company that owns yours."
"My biggest concerns with Vanguard stem from the Genshin breach, where their anticheat was breached and ran malware. It's not a case of trusting Riot to not abuse kernel level access on my machine, it is what could happen if bad actors gained access if they were breached [again](https://www.securityweek.com/riot-games-says-source-code-stolen-in-ransomware-attack). Coupled with the bad reputation that League's ""spaghetti code"" has, the notoriously bad functionality and reliability of the client/launcher, even after moving away from Adobe air, and financial ties to Tencent/China, it's difficult to give that level of trust and responsibility freely. 

Furthermore, I haven't played League competitively in many years. The only time I boot up the launcher is to occasionally play an ARAM, or check out the new TFT set. The thought of requiring me to have an always on, ring 0 process so that the top 0.1% of ranked players can have their competitive integrity maintained is such a bad deal. Frankly I don't care about ranked competitive integrity for a game I don't play competitively. Technical limitations aside, this measure should have been tied to an account's rank, a separate launcher, or the ranked queue itself. Forcing players that don't play ranked to have Vanguard is a gross overstep in my opinion.

I've played thousands of hours since Season 1 when Brand released, I've climbed to Masters rank across TFT, League, and LOR. I've dropped thousands of dollars of all manner of skins and cosmetics, and been a member of various communities in every shape this IP has taken form (Arcane, Legends of Runeterra, the indie spinoff games, TFT), but this is just a slap in the face. Especially when you read [this devblog](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-anti-cheat-in-lol-more/) that states as of 4 years ago:
> the average Gold IV player will encounter just one scripter in every 500 ranked games (or more likely, never).

> the cheaters of today get banned so fast and so frequently that most new scripting accounts never technically escape Silver

But now casual players must have anticheat installed because even ARAM and TFT see heinous scripting? Only 0.03% of players have seen any issues with Vanguard, but what about the amount of people that have uninstalled? Or people that haven't logged a formal support ticket, yet still had error codes crash out their games or restart their PCs? It feels like every official communication is filled with cherrypicked data to push a narrative, and written in a condescending way to appeal to the lowest common denominator. I'm disappointed.

I've uninstalled the launcher and won't be coming back.

So long and thanks for all the fish."
"I received error 152 (hardware ban) earlier today which confused the hell out of me, even more so because when logging into another account it worked fine.

I un- and reinstalled League which fixed it. Wasted a bunch of my time though."
"Chinese anti cheat program that runs on my computer at all times? Naaaa, I uninstalled the game."
Big thanks to the Vanguard team for finally motivating me to quit League. Couldn't have done it without you.
"I'm out. Get bent riot. League isn't worth you having kernel access.  It's a moba. a freaking moba. what kind of cheating can i do in a moba. this is ridiculous. I hope tthe us comes after riot games, a chinese company like it did tik tok. kernal access. what a joke."
"If you are not happy with Vanguard, stop playing the game. Vote with your time spent in the game. If enough players quit, they will take action. This level of anti cheat is not a necessity and it's just their decision."
"""The average gold4 player will encounter just one scripter every 500 games""
""The cheaters get banned so fast and so frequently that most new scripting accounts never technically escape silver""

That was a dev blog from Riot 4 years ago. And yet today we're forced to install Vanguard to play any game mode.. Or even any actual game LoL and TFT which doesn't need that kind of anti cheat. 

That's just the tip of the iceberg for me sadly. 

It's be interesting to see numbers in a few months but the average player's attention span is too short to still care about Vanguard at that moment ^^"
"""Company says nothing is wrong with their product. More news at 8"".
Stop huffing Tencent farts guys, it's sad. Uninstall this root-kit before it's to late, if it's not already.... No game is worth chinese spyware on your PC. This is the time to quit."
"holy hell, how is a regular player suppose to understand this? I appreciate the input, but man, this just makes me despise the vanguard decision even more."
".03% of players sounds like cherry picking a stat. Why don’t you post something like % of games ending in remakes yesterday? I played 3 in a row, all remakes. Or the number of dropped lobbies (dodges)? Surely you have better data on success than reports"
"I havent got the chance to update the game yet, but If I have to change some BIOS settings to get shit to work properly I just cant be bothered tbh because it'll probably fuck something else up haha"
"I might quit league due to Vanguard it sucks! Vanguard was a main reason I never played Valorent. It automatically stats every time you boot. It uses too many resources AND it causes software and hardware issues. Last night after a game my screens went black my computer froze AND my Discord automatically shut down and had to be restarted. Its been a good run league.

Edited for spelling."
"As long as vanguard is constantly forced to run at all times I will not be playing the game. As a diehard league player of 13 years who played on a collegiate level this is the straw. This combined with the lackluster rollout of skins, sub par events, horrible “battle passes”, questionable balance decisions and so much other stuff I can’t even count. It’s a shame because your gameplay design from map changes to baron changes have been incredible, but this has rendered the game unplayable for me. I can’t risk anything bricking my computer for any reason. My only experience with vanguard was that it screwed up my wifi on my windows 10 PC (no idea how, my buddy in IT just told me to uninstall and it fixed itself).

DotA 2 has a new player now. VALVe wins again by doing absolutely nothing. I’ll miss Caitlyn, I’ll miss my friends, I’ll definitely miss arena. But this is it.

Bye riot. I’ll see you for Arcane."
Your post is not true and I'll keep commenting until this decision is reverted. I am pretty sure Vanguard was the responsible for a blue screen -bricking my gaming PC. I uninstalled your game and will never come back to play it unless you guys stop requiring a malware to play a videogame. Whatever the reason is not justifiable and will never be. Good luck trying to contain the meltdown because I am sure this is coming
"Cant get passed my Bios :( trying stuff out but not a wizard. Phffffffff pc is fucked. wdym get battery out. are u kidding Just fwi, had to buy bew bios, and memory card. -500 THANK U LOT RIOT, i tried to get help on your costumer service couldnt send any tickets. So i hope ur games die because u dont derserve succes, sorry u fooled me once. Lost everthing DELETE RIOT GAMES GUYS"
But like why tho? Y'all gotta listen to the community this was probably the biggest waste of time lol no one hacks on league and with the type of game it is if you're ass you're probably not gonna do well even with scripts. Fix the grown ass men having temper tantrums over league
How would riot get info of vanguard bricking pc's if the pcs they report on is bricked?
"I would personally like to thank the riot team for implementing vanguard it finally made me quit league after years and years of playing. Before anyone shouts cheater.. Its nothing to do with that it's genuinely a situation whereas over the past 6 years I've probably seen 6 cheaters.. I don't particularly see that as a reason to have a permanently on kernel level program with limitless access to the machine I bank and work on. 


Myself and about 10 irl friends who used to play every night (some for the past 8+ years) have all quit for the same reason.. anyone with any level of IT security knowledge would not want this on their pc.


 Riot may not do anything malicious but they are vulnerable and vanguard is essentially an open door to your computer and it's data, riot has the key.. but that's not to say it can't be stolen. But honestly consider it guys, the price is too high and we can't let companies get away with this level of instrusion. 


 On a happier note I'm finally balls deep in rimworld anomaly so no hate it's actually alot more fun.. lol is just addictive 😂"
"I have been playing League for 12 years.

The fact that a game wants me to hack my Own computer to change the Bios settings(something I have never heard of until 3 days ago) and since I potentially could fuck my computer up, I just said fuck it and quit league.

Its toxic asf for a guy who’s In game name is Anotherblackman anyways so I don’t know why I stayed this long.

Been looking for a reason to give Jagex my money again anyways"
"I ended up uninstalling both League and Vanguard because Vanguard screwed with my USB drivers. Now every so often my keyboard and mouse would disconnect and any attempt to uninstall the drivers would BSOD my computer.

Never had any issues till the restart Vanguard required and I'm still fixing this stupid issue.

Edit: Grammar and typo fixes.

Edit 2: After going through so many attempts to fix it - doing a sfc scan, doing a C-drive scan and repair, updating BIOS - which fixed the BSOD, and finally reinstalling my USB drivers? My mouse and keyboard is still fucked. I think Vanguard literally fucked up the hardware on both of them, so thanks Riot.

Edit 3: Finally fixed it after two days total of troubleshooting. The solution that fixed it is: uninstalling the USB Root Hub drivers, unplugging everything from my USB ports, turn computer off and unplug from outlet, power cycle (hold power button) for 30-45 seconds, turn computer on and wait till it fully restarts, THEN replug everything else into their USB slots. THAT fixed the issue in case anyone else is experiencing the same thing as me in terms of their keyboard/mouse frequently disconnecting and reconnecting.

Never had this issue until the fateful restart that Riot Vanguard required. At this point? Unless they make some changes to Vanguard - such as NOT having it run constantly, then I'm not ever gonna reinstall League. It's bullshit that an anti-cheat effectively fucked with the hardware on my computer like it did."
"Lol nice post! Keep your shitty chinese spyware to yourself, you and every other riot employee is a complete sellout."
"> At this point in time, **we have not confirmed any instances of Vanguard bricking anyone’s hardware**

Lmao. You guys are dishonest as shit"
"Update from a League player of many years:

I've just uninstalled the game, and I intend to uninstall it on any machine that I find of mine that might still have it. I admit that I haven't been as active in the game lately. I've been busy getting a CS degree. However, post graduation, I have still found within myself a small urge to pick up the game once in a while. No more, however. It is not because I am a cheater. You're welcome to check my entire game history. I have a couple of accounts due to a hiccup that happened a long time back that made one of my accounts inaccessible for a time, but I'm sure you'd be able to find me by my Reddit name if you tried. (It wasn't banned or anything, I just made an account, some error happened, and I had to make a new account as I literally was never able to log into my first one).

I will tell you why in no uncertain terms, and while I'm sure your team won't read this, I'm still going to put this out there.

Whoever on your team decided that this was a good idea needs to go back to Cybersecurity 101. I've read your posts. I've read your explanations. I've read your FAQ's on this. I've yet to have my main and most major concerns addressed. Your team is too large and with too much talent to have never broached these topics, so I can only assume that you KNOW that your answers to my concerns are going to be unsavory at best if answered honestly. I'll begin with proving my reading of your articles, and setting up the main issues that I have before coming out with them.

Firstly, I'll address the kernel level thing. Yes, I know. All anti-cheat software is kernel according to your articles, etc. Yes, yes, yes, I know. Hence why I have been phasing out my game library when games use kernel level anti-cheat. I don't agree with it. I try to avoid as many games with kernel level anti-cheat as possible. I am not comfortable with software written by other people having that level of control on my system. Ken Thompson, often credited as the creator of the C language, has come straight out and said that you cannot actually trust any software that you did not compile yourself, on any machine that you did not build yourself, and that you did not bootstrap yourself fully. I don't care how good your intentions are, I will not willingly give that level of control over my system over. Unless I ACTUALLY know, beyond just PR releases, what is ACTUALLY happening with your software, I won't willingly hand over my system so readily.

Second, your articles have tried to say that ANY piece of software could be ill-intentioned and can spy on you. Even software that isn't kernel level... To which I say, YES! Cybersecurity is GENUINELY terrifying once you get into it and learn just how much you are being spied upon daily by those apps that you trust. I fight these as best I can by only allowing specific programs access through my firewall through the use of my anti-virus, but no matter how hard I fight, I'm sure that SOME information about my system is still being harvested, but until we solve the problem of cybersecurity (a problem which I actually don't think is one that can be solved, but you're free to contest that point if you like) I will staunch the bleeding at every point that I can and fight tooth and nail. It does not do to make that easier by just handing over kernel level control willy-nilly at every turn. Sure, we try to trust the software of people where we can, and perhaps that trust is often misplaced. However, the main problem with the obfuscation of your kernel level anti-cheat is that no matter what you say on paper, *we are not able to audit your software*. That right there is the killer. No auditing allowed, just your word.

Thirdly, a large portion of people aren't even actually concerned with your software working as intended. Read the bloody comments. A large portion of complaints are:

1. Your software is causing technical difficulties

2. Your software is interfering in unrelated activities

3. Your software is causing issues with actually playing the game legitimately even after jumping through your hoops.

Yes, I concede, these are anecdotes on a public forum. It's entirely possible that some people are just very unhappy with the anti-cheat and will lie about their situation. However, with the sheer volume and density of these comments, I really struggle to believe that there isn't at least a kernel (cwutididthar?) of truth to their complaints.

Which brings me to my own concerns, and why this is a killer for me, and it should be for literally every player:

# It does not matter how much I trust your team, I cannot trust your software.

Let us just naively assume for a moment that your team has the literal best of intentions. The people who put this software together are starry-eyed, passionate programmers that LOVE their job, and have NO malicious intent whatsoever. They have put together, to the best of their abilities, software that will ONLY do what it says on the tin, and what it says on the tin is that it will fight cheating.

Your software has a massive target on its back. Access to millions of machines, globally? Do you have any idea how much literally ANY country's cybersecurity and hacker divisions would pay the first person to crack that to gain admin control on a client machine? The second that a hole is found, that's going to be MILLIONS of machines that can have some sleeper program enabled. Perhaps one that runs with little to no imprint on its system. Maybe it even invades your boot sector and your backups and just sits there, dormant. Wait a week or two for your largest market of machines to log in, and BAM. If you have root access to millions of machines, you can execute the largest [insert malicious attack] attack that we've seen yet in computing history. Global ransomware. Global privacy invasions. Global spyware.

""Not going to happen,"" you say. That's merely conspiratorial and paranoid thinking... And yet, if you know about computing and cybersecurity... Are you really so sure? Anyone who cracks that software has kernel level access to your system. What DON'T they have permission to execute? As long as I have time to prepare a script, just 10 seconds of root time on a machine is all I'd need to own it, and if I'm really good, I'd own it without the person who has the machine even knowing.

Sure, your anti-cheat has slightly different variations throughout the various regions, but even if a SINGLE region were to be attacked, that is still potentially a multi-million user honeypot. That's billions of ransomed machines, and that's before you even factor into account if you get access to machines that are inside private networks and can be turned into sleepers that attack other machines on the same network. How long before you hit a machine with national security secrets on it? How much damage can be done if that information is sold to a bad actor? How much damage if the person executing the attack IS themselves a bad actor?

All of this, and that is if I actually fully trusted your team and believed that not a single person in your entire company with any access to this has a single malicious thought, or even a lapse in judgment that would allow such a vulnerability. However, we are all human. Imagine if someone on your team wanted to spy on a personal friend or colleague that they knew, and they had every opportunity to use your software to do so? Imagine if someone pulling the strings had the authority to order some poor intern to do that without the full scope of what they implemented? Imagine if a government of a country got that kind of control? Would you hand your medical records over to a stranger? Would you give your social security number to someone you've never met? Would you give pictures of your children to a man who asks you to just trust them on the other side of a security screen?

You can tell me all day until you're blue in the face: ""Trust me bro. We run when your computer starts, but we ONLY care about the game you play. Despite having all of the power and ability in the world to invade every sector of your hard drive, to listen in on your keyboard strokes, to spy on your banking transactions, we *promise* we won't EVER at ANY point EVER have a situation with ANYONE who violates that trust for ANY reason.""

Sorry, but I'm not going to trust that software. Goodbye, League of Legends. Maybe I'll consider you someday again if you decide that this was the wrong turn and remove this practice. For now, however, I must fight wherever I can, no matter how futile the fight. This is where the line in the sand must be drawn."
How is someone with a bricked software due to vanguard is supposed to submit a ticket to complain if their pc is dead lol it has to be a joke
"Might wanna be cautious about claiming that 0.03%, perhaps with a more commonly accepted definition of “reported issues” we will see a much different statistics."
"I would openly thank you for finally giving me the perfect, non-deniable opportunity to finally quit the game for good. Vanguard is a mess"
"Yeah… this is where I have to draw the line.

I know kernel level anti cheats are a thing, but I rarely play league these days (have been a player since 2013), so I’m not putting up with something that’s always on at a kernel level just so once every few weeks I can play league. 

This is a massive shame. And whether or not it technically complies with current privacy laws(across the globe?), it feels like an invasion of privacy.

Obviously, I wouldn’t mind it being on while I’m playing league. But it’s fucked that you think we should have to have it on all the time. 

So I guess this is goodbye for now."
"Just learned I would need to install vanguard to play league of legends in the future, haven't played in a while so I guess this is a good time to quit completely.

Was a good run for 13 years while it lasted."
Vanguard broke league for me. It made it “2 Tb” and refused to open league cuz of permissions even though I’m admin. I had to uninstall
I want to thank Riot for adding Vanguard. I am now much more productive in my life having not played League of Legends since.
"I've been playing nearly every day, with a few breaks, since beta in 2009. 15 years of my life, thousands of hours, hundreds of euros poured into this game. I loved it with everything I have, throughout the ups and downs, but this feels like a step too far. I feel betrayed, and reading the comments, I'm relieved to see I'm not alone in that at least.

  
How Riot thinks Vanguard is the only way forward is bewildering to me. As mentioned by many others, far more knowledgable in this area than myself, there's other ways of doing anti-cheat. Less intrusive and more inclusive methods. The privacy concerns are alarming, but even more than that the security threats this pose on all your users should have been enough to stop this from ever making it to live. Even if everything you say is true, which I'll be honest is a bit difficult to believe, there's still the risk of bad actors gaining access to users' systems through this backdoor. Getting rid off a few bad apples cannot possibly be worth it with all the damage caused with this update.

  
Riot, you are pushing away even the most loyal of your players with this move. I just hope that you can see that before it is too late."
"I didn't play league, only TFT and now this forces me to quit playing on PC. Vanguard is the reason i didn't try touching Valorant. Way too intrusive for my liking."
"I just feel like Vanguard is overkill. During my accumulated 9 years of playing League, I can only recall 2 times where I've encountered someone that I suspect was cheating.

This kind of invasive surveillance software is something that you'd need to use against dangerous convicted felons. Not some random loser that uses cheats in an online game."
I've opened a case one week ago because Vanguard is blocking my hard disk drivers and no one gave me a solution.
"The Client was already fucking garbage and didnt work half the time, now with Vanguard nothing works. Just get rid of Vanguard holyyy"
"Despite wanting to play Valorant, I refused to allow Vanguard on my devices, so no Valorant. I've played League for quite a long time, but I will not allow Vanguard to be on my devices, so I won't be playing it. It wouldn't be as much of an issue for me if Tencent didn't own the company. For those of you who don't know, Chinese companies like Tencent (and by extension their subsidiaries) are REQUIRED by Chinese law to send all user data to the Chinese government and/or provide a backdoor for the CCP to steal it themselves. Effectively any information that Riot obtains through Vanguard or any other means must be sent to the Chinese government, which I'm not comfortable with. Love the games, don't like my data being syphoned to the CCP."
"Only way to fix this issue is boycott this whole league, it sounds very stupid but imagine I played league since 2012/2011 and as much as I can remember this system can only result in buying a specific PC and vanguard is definitely going to cross privacy rules. Just imagine it is the richest company in the world they can buy riot and it is possible riot has sold themselves to vanguard but the transfer need to be done smoothly so not everyone can notice it. So for your own safety just uninstall league, RIP Riot and good luck everyone."
"Can we make a petition to remove Vanguard since it requires TPM 2.0 and windows 11. A lot of players i know personally and I have been one myself use low end PC-s and League was known for that. Everything on LOW graphic and your game runs on 40-60fps… not anymore, thanks riot.."
">Since 14.9 went live, fewer than 0.03% of players have reported issues with Vanguard.

Found your problem. People aren't reporting it they are just uninstalling it along with your games. Probably why you felt the need/were directed to write this post"
"Been playing since S2. I've seen a grand total of two players who I suspected of cheating and even then they could have just been very good or smurfing. Cheating isn't a problem in League and never has been. 


I wish Riot would just be honest and refer to this as an Anti-Botting initiative. It's no mistake that you always lump cheaters and bots together to inflate the total number and make it seem like cheating is a bigger issue than it actually is. 


I'd respect it a hell of a lot more if you just came out and said ""Bots waste resources and farm crafting items which hurts our bottom line."" It's wild to me how much ink has been spilled in an attempt to fabricate a cheating issue. "
"Don't let them gaslight you, kernel-level drivers are not OK

> Security Vulnerabilities: Kernel-level drivers have extensive privileges and can potentially access sensitive areas of your system. Insecurely designed or poorly implemented drivers can introduce vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or compromise system integrity."
I want to take a moment to thank riot for helping me finally quit league. Yall ain't ever getting my kernel.
"I played LoL for the first 3 years of its life, every single evening. I quit once the playerbase started becoming too toxic for my liking. Recently, a friend from that time who still plays told me about how big Riot had become, and how much better LoL was now, so I reinstalled it and was having a great old time playing the ""new"" LoL. 

Until 2 days ago, that is. I thought it was really weird it asked for a system reboot after updating. I looked into it and was horrified to find just how intrusive Vanguard is. I uninstalled the game, sadly. Even more regrettably, I had bought enough Riot Points to buy myself 3 skins and still had 3k left. So I'm proper pissed. 

I really, \*really\* hope Riot finds an alternative way so I can come back to the game. I tolerate anti-cheat systems that run WHILE the game is running, like Easy or Cheetah, but not something that runs ALL THE TIME and has so much power over my PC. No matter what they say, I'm not having it.

Good day."
phreak throwing shit at the wall in the balance team room + vanguard spyware is what finally made me quit this game
">**we have not confirmed any instances of Vanguard bricking anyone’s hardware**

I know this is true technically, but simultaneously, players following the instructions and making their computer (only temporarily from what i understand)unusable due to changing BIOS settings does happen, and that's usually what people talk about.

So there ARE people reporting 'bricking their hardware' but that's overlooked either by the dev team not considering those as 'bricked' or not considering those as caused by vanguard, which just seems kinda iffy."
You know how to avoid all these problems? Remove it and instead try to do a actually put in a minimum amount of effort into actually trying to detect cheaters/botted accounts. PvE was infested with hilariously stupid bots for years and you didn't even but in an effort to catch those.
"How about the issue where Vanguard is fucking running, but I get into game and it says it isn’t, so I lose the game due to afk and then get LP penalties?

Is this because of my computer sleeping?"
Wouldn't it be better if Vanguard only launched with riot client. Not at start of Windows but let's say riot client. It's still working on ring 0 so it can scan our PC thoroughly before we launch game and would not force us to turn off OC/UV settings + fan curves.
"This is really great and all, and I respect the commitment to arguing that Vanguard shouldn't be able to cause any hardware issues, however it is concerning that people claim that the Vanguard update has caused computers to brick. Seeing Riot stubbornly defend that the implementation of Vanguard has nothing to do with issues mentioned has only made me more nervous about playing any more games of LoL. I still love playing this game, and with the launch of arena I would really like to play again, but considering the laptop I use to play League is also used for all of my schoolwork, it is too big of a risk for me to (as unlikely as Riot claims it is that it will cause hardware issues) launch any new games, meaning this is probably the end of my almost 10 year run of playing League of Legends. It really sucks that this will be the reason I quit playing."
"League of legends hangs itself, cant close the game, Task amnager doesnt even work on it.

I get into a Lobby, Exact same second - van84 Error - ""No connection"". I get a penalty and a que timer. You are not serious. When will we get our LP back for all the PC restarts some people gotta do? 

Or do we wait 3 months? What is the deal? The Riot Support itself isn't answering tickets either. Idk man. Scuffed."
"I've played league since the beta, and this is one of the worst states I've seen the client in. It frequently hangs and sometimes crashes when I alt tab, throws error messages at me frequently, and I've had to force close the client several times in the past day or two. Extremely annoying. 

I frankly think it's gross to require anticheat that's this invasive.

Might just throw in the towel and migrate my friend group over to other games. Get an ipad or something for my TFT addiction."
"This is absolute horseshit.  Vanguard very much DID brick my machine until I uninstalled it. Fuck off riot.  It's acceptable to me to have a shitty program that doesn't run, fine, I'll play something else. But when you install shit on my PC that makes NONE of my other games or any apps run, fuck you."
"Constantly rebooting your pc is bad for the pc, no?"
"You forgot the part where being a developer using vm, virtual box or any other virtualization platform does not work with vanguard without back n forth switching in boot menu. Literally Vanguard is why I stopped playing Valorant and now it’s wraps for League ig. All this anti cheat n you won’t even stop boosting pros n paid accounts lmao. That’s the real problem"
"Not a bot, tired of companies thinking its ok to shadow load programs on my computer or even install. Vanguard does nothing to prevent the purchase and use of 3rd party stuff and even then the amount of times that actual cheaters do it, is almost none existent as is"
"This HAS to be untrue. Ive experienced problems with it EVERY DAY! SO many things are wrong with it. It bogs doen the already unresponsive client, it runs in the background as a 3rd party app, it closes the app with any error every time. Nobody was cheating. Its worse than useless. Its worse than before by a LONG shot."
Uninstalled all of riot games.Not worth the effort for a dying game.
Unistalled the game. No point in playing a game that requires an kernel level software that look at my files. Do Riot wanna see my nudes? Just ask me
"    uninstall this shit, until this slutty company takes shame and reformulates a decent anticheat. the efficiency of this garbage is the same as VAC, why doesn't Valve also start VAC at Kernel Level 24/7? It smells like spyware. Are you going to delete my comment, you little clown?"
"    uninstall this shit, until this slutty company takes shame and reformulates a decent anticheat. the efficiency of this garbage is the same as VAC, why doesn't Valve also start VAC at Kernel Level 24/7? It smells like spyware. Are you going to delete my comment, you little clown?"
"I haven't played since I heard this change was coming, and it's been fantastic. I refuse to install this garbage malware. Preventing other things from running on my PC instead of just warning me? Running at boot, always being on, conflicting with other applications? Enforcing certain BIOS and Windows settings? For one fucking game? Fuck off."
Riot literally took the worst decision for the game since inception.
"Was going to log on and then I saw that malware update was finally being rolled out, so I came here.

Now I'm reading it has problems with MSI afterburner/RTSS. After 10 years Riot helped me quit lul"
"RIOT is owned by tencent, tencent is a Chinese company, and China has a law that requires companies to turn over all and every data they collect.
They will never implement this because they're banking on people being too lazy to restart their computer to dis/enable vanguard to stop it from spying on you.
Vanguard has access to *everything* on your computer. You might as well call the chinese government and give them a compiled list of every bit of data you know about yourself, every single password for every single website you use, and tencent would probably still know more about you thanks to vanguard.
So, yeah. In case you wondered *why* this was never going to happen"
  same here I uninstalled about 2 weeks ago when I heard of Vanguard and checked now to see how it iwas going. It's sad I really enjoyed the game but fuck this
In riots eyes and their countless bot accounts on forums you will just be labelled a butthurt cheater 
I feel the same. I really don't mind an anti-cheat software running for the game because I do want no cheaters in my games but I don't want something running all the time when I'm a casual player with maybe 5 games max per week and I certainly don't want it to have this level of access especially regarding Riot's history with user data
"Same happened to me. Got the Leaver penalty in ranked too, brutal."
"Closing the LoL client itself when it freezes also did this to me, which is worse because it doubles (or more if no SSD) the time it takes you to get back into the match."
The League client itself is a steaming pile of garbage they've refused to fix for like 10 years now. You think they're gonna use dev time giving us an actual tft specific one?
"It's beyond insane that we now have to install an intrusive, unacceptable anti-cheat to play a game that won't use that anti-cheat, just because Riot forces us to install another game (League) only for them to be concerned we may cheat in that game we don't even want to install in the first place.

Is it really that hard to allow me to use the League client without Vanguard, and just deny me the option to join League of Legends games without Vanguard?"
"i uninstalled, i dont want vanguard mess with my pc without restrictions and collect my info 24/7, i dont allow windows do it , i will not allow LoL do it"
"I unistalled back on 14.5  because of the upcoming Vanguard  addition. I figured I'd just rip the band-aid off and be done with it. Now I just lurk here and see what people thought thus far, I feel no regrets."
"Oh I'm sure there were a bunch. I uninstalled the game 2 weeks ago.


Riot can't protect their own shit. They had data breaches 3 fucking times. And now people are allowing them to install a kernel level program on your system?


No thanks. Zero trust in Riot."
"I for sure did, right before the go live date. The amount of gas lighting and people attacking those concerned about it is just ridiculous. I work in IT and know how not only crazy intrusive it is but also a big security concern. Their statements were also not quite true defending their push of this software. Like how they said it doesn't track anything you do, but somehow sends data of what has happened since the last time you launched the client to Riot."
No didn't you hear only 0.03% reported a problem everyone loves it!
"thats one interesting question for sure. I don't think they answer it now because of simple pr. but if they don't answer it ever at all it makes them also look bad. for sure there must be at least a few percent of the playerbase that have a different pov on it, simply struggle or some left because stuff gets to complicated (especially on their old systems)."
"Are you on Windows 10?  This error on LoL could mean your Windows 10 version is out of date—it has to be at least version 1803 (Redstone 4).

If you're already up to date, it could be conflicting anti-virus software that is killing Vanguard.  You'd need to submit a ticket with Vanguard logs for us to find out what's doing it."
"No you see, if we just call every account that uninstalled/got deleted bot accounts there's actually a big drop of bot accounts"
"Same thing for me, but it completely kills discord too. Idk if it's Vanguard, but it happened 3 times in 4 hours today."
"Those ""instantly move the mouse (or move the mouse the exact same way every time) to this position and click on it"" kinds of programs are exactly what Vanguard was made to detect and ban for. Chances are, you'd be banned pretty quickly for using that kind of thing unfortunately. 

From Vanguard's perspective, it's pretty hard for it to tell the difference between someone using a flute to move a mouse around to predetermined positions (which is hilarious btw, I bet your streams would be fun as heck) versus just a bot program that snaps the mouse around and stuff."
There's been a lot of people reporting issues specifically with Citrix or Anydesk (Remoting software) along with some overclocking software. Wonder if there's a cheatsheet of common things that people should disable if they're having trouble.
"Citrix deserve a hate thread, jesus what a piece of crap software ..."
"Same. The fans get very angry on startups, too, which they def didn't do before."
"Same thing on my end while playing Star Rail. I just uninstalled and deleted LoL, Vaguard, LoR (not using Vanguard but fuck it) and everything related to Riot 🤷‍♂️"
Lmao. No wonder they have so few reports of issues. They are deleting them.
"This post screams damage control. Personally i didint have any issues, but i presume lots of people have and thats why this post was made."
"Considering they replied to a question about how many people uninstalled because of vanguard with ""they can't disclose that number"", the statistics are inherently flawed indeed"
"Obviously not a Rioter but this is probably not Vanguard related, I also use Mudfish and some time in the past few weeks (before Vanguard even made it to PBE) their basic pay per traffic Item Mode stopped functioning with League for me. The Full VPN mode still works just fine even after Vanguard but uses a ton of traffic so is obviously not the greatest. I've been in contact with them to try and get it fixed, requires updating of the item settings on their end.  

Edit: it's been fixed"
"Reminds me of the classic thing where League closed (dunno if they fixed it) if you had a window named Cheat Engine opened. Not like Cheat Engine the program; if you had a folder or text document or active web page open called ""Cheat Engine"" it would just close as soon as you started it up."
"> I’m devastated that I have to give league up

Same :/ I love playing a few games after work. I love ADC and playing Jinx and Cait. But I refuse to have Vanguard on my system. So now I've basically been forced out of one of my favourite games. I have a feeling the people who are okay with Vanguard are 1) teenagers and don't care about privacy invasions or 2) don't really know what Vanguard even is and don't care otherwise."
"> Update: I was able to get my PC to start again by following what LS said worked for him on twitter - resetting my CMOS battery in my motherboard

Do you think the average user is going to know how to take their PC apart and remove the CMOS battery to reset BIOS? This thing is a fucking mess"
">Vanguard running 24/7 is the worst pricivacy violation since mcafee.

It's such an absurd thing to ask of their players. Luckily for them most people either won't understand the implications or simply won't care. It's just one more thing invading their privacy, after all."
Custom skins have always been use at your own risk. By installing and using one you accept the possibility that you might get banned for it.
"This is why I came here... I assumed it was going to be them apologizing for all of the crashes.


In my experience vanguard causes at least one person to crash at least once in every arena game. With the ""you need vanguard running"" error (despite vanguard running). This leads me to believe 50% of real games are effected though I haven't been playing anything but arena."
"That's around ~54,000 people, that potentially took the time to write in. I doubt it's that low"
"The reason they don't give the better data is because it would look way, way, way, way worse for them. Obviously a minority of people will open a ticket about their issue with Vanguard. They know that, and we know that, so it's a bit insulting to still offer that stat with complete poker face."
"It's worse than that, imagine Vanguard but instead of controlled by Rito, it's controlled by hackers.   
Hack it once and you own millions of computers (all PCs running LoL or Valorant), gaining complete operating system level control (the highest level of control, more than the user has).

But don't you worry, Rito is 100% perfect they NEVER EVER have any bugs."
Being able to play TFT / aram without vanguard would be cool. My whole friend group quit league with vanguard coming. One got bios error and lost all his stuff. The other two. One doesn’t trust vanguard and the other it kills their frames. They only played aram and tft. I never cared much about someone scripting in aram it’s a coin flip for fun mode. I’m sure player base dropped and this could be a solution.
"Why can't you guys enforce Vanguard only during ranked play? As one of those fabled 800 Linux League players who also has around 7,000 ARAM games, I'm pretty bummed out that because of some competitive integrity kick my League retirement home has been bulldozed.

Hell, put me in cheater queue with Xerath scripters or something. It's better than not being able to play."
isn't having to disable this everytime more effort than turning it off every time you turn on your PC.  Which is the thing people are mad about and want to avoid
everyone in this thread is getting ignored or bland useless PR responses. this is a farce.
"Maybe only by saying: “Yes, now a lot of CHEATERS and SCRIPTERS left the League, so Vanguard is good”…"
"I love the statistics of ""only 0.9% of players experience some issue"" because they conveniently avoid the part that is no longer an active player due to this. To be perfectly fair to them, not much they can do about those players so realistically there's no reason to keep stats about them but I'm a spiteful bastard. I already uninstalled the game years ago and mostly lurking because I like to read some of the balance discussions but even if I wanted to reinstall it the TPM requirement is enough to stop me.

Edit: out of curiosity I dug a big and turns out I have a TPM module in my pc I'm just a dumbass and didn't realize it so just assumed I don't have it and installed win 11 with Rufus to bypass the requirement. You live and learn."
"I'm sure they have, but I don't imagine the numbers are relevant enough. The average person will not understand the security risks of installing a kernel. So they will not care."
Can you implement an animation of a hammer zapping the cheaters names with lightning before the name turns to dust? Bet public punishment and display if the banhammer would be popular.
"I'm not exactly an expert in software/programming but it just feels like a massive ethical problem that something from a game I am explicitly choosing not to run at that moment, that is not an integral part of running my computer, still has access to my computer and is forced to be running.

Also, the screenshotting thing, I don't care if its only enabled for Valorant, I never want any software on my computer that can forcibly take screenshots of anything on my desktop and send it without my knowledge."
"Yeah but that’s not the point. If you have a 0.03% people, then out of 10,000 people you only expect 3 people to have issues. For OP to be a 3/10000 and both of their friends to be 3 in 10,000 too has a probability of 27/1,000,000,000,000 (that’s 1 trillion btw). It’ll be a bit better than that due to binomial distribution but it won’t be insanely higher. I put it on an online calculator and it just gave me back zero because it didn’t do that high precision. The odds are so stupidly low that if its true it’s effectively proof that the number is a lie"
They'll just lump those players into bots category and pat themselves on the back. Personally not a huge fan with this method to ban hackers especially with the stupid vanguard has to be running 24/7 even when the client is closed.
"I hate that this puts a precedent for so many future privacy violations, like some game asked their customers to install some super invasive kernel-level  software that is running 24/7 and they all were like ""ok"" and said game is one of the most played games"
"That’s significant. I wonder if their number is of total accounts, or active users. I suspect it’s a much higher percent of users who played yesterday.

Also notice they didn’t compare other tickets not tagged as “Vanguard” either. I reported a crash yesterday and didn’t even see an option for selecting “Vanguard”. These numbers mean nothing without more context"
"I find it weird that they said there's only 800 Linux players.
Same number they said years ago while the desktop Linux users quadruplicated.
Just one of the subreddits alone has more than 10x more users than that (and it was higher before iirc).
They said Linux wasn't supported bc they couldn't have a chain to trust but yet MacOS isn't required to support Vanguard.
No saying that someone lied, just find it weird."
They have their heads buried in the sand quite literally
"1% of over 50 million people is still a shitton of people.

And most people dont even report issues, many just delete the game instead or fix it themselves if they can or just hope it goes away and stop for now.

The software is horrible and i for one will leave the game uninstalled as long as Vanguard exists in its current invasive and draconian form."
"Unless they have some way of monitoring random crashes caused by vanguard, it’s only 0.9% of users reported issues. That also doesn’t count the percentage that quit, so some percentage of the users not experiencing issues could just be those that quit."
I think that stat might be helped by the fact that there's no obvious way to report a Vanguard error.
"it's funny how they say ""no reports of bricked pc"" like it was an achievement lol....

it's a game, the bare minium is that it doesn't brick your pc!!

and later they say ""oh well, there are players that enabled secure boot and bricked the pc because it always display black screen, you can fixe it by buying a new vga monitor and attaching it to mobo instead of videocard"""
Everyone who is critical of vanguard is being labelled a bot or cheater... It's a weird tactic for a game company to divide and create hate amongst it's playerbase... anyone who has played league is fully aware it is not full of cheats .. weird tactic usually seen by the Russian military or CCP 
"I wanted to play until the last moment of .8 patch, to form some last Leauge memories I could remember as an old man one day, but I found myself so discouraged by what is about to happen that my last game was in .7 patch...

Who am I kidding, I'll probably have dementia anyway."
Riot misrepresenting data numbers for their own narrative? NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
also it's blatantly not true- LS has reported Vanguard bricked 2 of his PCs
"I just booted up league for the first time in ~a week. it updated and now I have a 9001 then 1067 error.   Also on windows 11.
I guess I have to go figure out how to enable tpm 2.0"
"We aren't allowed to voice criticism because you are of different opinion?

When they released the skin I thought there was some kind of exclusivity. So I got these skins since I thought they will not be obtainable in the future."
"thats you way of thinking (mine too btw. i didn't realize that my cool looking ghost Nocturne skin is/was legendary)

But i can understand others, who feel betrayed.
i mean riot said, in other words promised, that those skins will only be purchasable specified time than they won't be available - FOREVER!

SO the Cake was a lie

"
"Even though I am one of the people who really really wants to buy these skins, I can't help but thinking it's wrong. What's the point of having limited edition skins if they're going to do this? I feel sorry for the people who bought them when they were available, the banner and rp back does not compensate for this imo. No one is going to care if you bought it first and therefore the banner is pointless. "
"I own Kitty Kat Katarina, Candy Cane MF, and Red Card Kat. I might own a few more but those three I know I have for sure. I bought them when they came out because I love playing those champs and the skins were pretty different from what existed at the time. I also bought them because Riot said buy them now or you can never have them. Ever. So I bought them, my choice to buy them was not because of pure selfish desire to have something no one else would be able to get, but it was part of my choice.

I just hate how this whole thing came out, it's basically put anyone who has the skins and liked the exclusive aspect of them in the position where if you do complain about it you're marked a whiner and selfish.

Even better is the fact that those who stand directly to benefit from the sale get to then turn around and look down their nose at anyone complaining saying ""What they're refunding you the RP and giving you some other stuff stop complaining that's fair.""

It's pretty easy to say compensation is fair when you're not the one who's having to deal with the compensation. Plus the RP was bought not entirely but partly because this skin was going to be limited. Yes I'm getting RP back but that's not nearly the same as a true refund. My money is still spent, however the reason I spent it is no longer there. The loading screen shit does nothing for me, the border isn't nearly at the value that the overall rarity of the skin is at and I'd rather use my santa baron icon than this piece of crap.

Look I can live with the sale if they can find a better way to compensate those who had the skin. Hell I'd be happy with double RP returns because those skins clearly have a greater value due to their rarity."
"I don't own any vintage skin, and I hate this decision.

Here's the thing: vintage skins were promoted as something that you could buy now, or never. People who normally don't buy skins bought them because of it. 

Then a couple of years later Riot just says ""tee-hee, kidding, we are going to sell them again"". That makes the original sale a lie. Let me iterate: it means that Riot was LYING when selling skins. How would that not piss off someone who paid?

Maturity or not, exclusivity/uniqueness makes something worth more. That's true for sport cars, that's true for fashion, that's true for celebrity autographs, that's true for first edition things. You shelled money for something, and then 2 years later it just loses everything that made it special (because let's face it, most vintage skins were just basic recolors). In return, you get far less RP than the skin is currently worth, and 2 things that are absolutely useless.

**TL:DR : it's not about maturity, it's about lies and fraudolent marketing**"
"I'm sorry for the people who have the skins. If that was me, i'd be pissed. "
"As someone who doesn't own any of these skins and has only seen two of them in a game ever, I completely agree with the people who demand exclusivity.  Riot is breaking a promise it made to its customers.  Should people expect honesty from a company?  No, and I guess this proves that Riot is no better than any other company.

By the same token, I'm totally buying ""Definitely Not Blitzcrank""

Yes, my hypocrisy knows no bounds."
"It's not about old skins becoming available again , it's about riot saying they were discontinued skins and opening them again later. It's basically false advertising and lying. "
"It's not that people are greedy assholes and don't want anyone to experience the joy of owning one of the skins. It's a matter of principal that at the end of the day Riot once again lied to its early adopters, and people feel burned by that. That being said I'm very happy you guys will get the skins now. There's just a vocal minority on both sides of the issue that are beating this to death, can't we all just get along? "
"I might get down voted for this but people are missing the point as to why people are upset.

They said that the skin was only going to be in the store once and a lot of people bought the skins because of that.

I find it funny that people were getting mad at american express serve for changing their policy and then parade when Riot did the same thing. "
"How is wanting to keep the rarity of your skins immature? We bought the skins knowing it would never be released again. Tough shit if you werent here to buy it, we invested into these limited skins just because they were 'limited'. Riot screwed over all their oldest and most loyal customers who supported them from the beginning. Most of these skins will only be purchased cause of the rarity, once Riot makes it all available they lose their value and flair. Compensating with a watermark and a border that everyone alt tabs out of is disgusting.  If we wanted more RP or a stupid border and icon we wouldve payed separately for them."
"Can we acknowledge the fact that some people buy skins simply because they are limited edition? Those people are getting fucked. I don't care that they are releasing them again because there are a few that I plan on picking up, but exclusivity is a selling point for some and those people are getting screwed.

Advertising something as limited edition and then taking it back is going to piss off some people and rightfully so.

>EDIT: Dayum, some kids are mad! Some of them act like they have been robbed or something.. Selfishness is bad kids. But don't worry, most of you will grow out of it (hopefully)

Look at this monkey. People are posting perfectly reasonable responses and this chucklehead turns into a 15-year-old. You showed us. Good thing you called everyone ""kid"". Very ""mature""."
"I completely disagree with you. Riot said that these skins would only be sold for a limited amount of time - hence they would be quite rare. I feel that I have used money on some skins, that I were promised would be rare, but now everyone can buy them. It's simply unfair."
"Its so simple, just imagine you have some rare coin, there is only 10 coins like this on the whole world. Then you read in newspaper there will be produced like 1kk the same coins so everybody can get it. I dont have any of this rare skins but i can feel why people are not so happy about this sale. sorry for bad englado."
"As an owner of several vintage skins I fully support this decision. The fact of the matter is their ""promise"" of this being limited availability was a terrible idea and came from an era when League was a completely different animal. You have to realize that when most of these skins came out League was TINY (relatively speaking), I mean we're talking like 1/50th of the user base, their revenues were nowhere near what they are now, and they were still fledglings as a company in general. I'd be surprised if ANY business decisions/plans/whatever they made back then would be even remotely applicable to the game today given the massive change in scale.

And let's be honest, plenty of these skins are not of amazing quality (blitzcrank with a jersey! ezreal with a jersey! I mean come on, toboggan corki was a *legendary* and is nowhere near up to snuff for a legendary), plenty were just recolors, and plenty were terribly unpopular when they were available.

I really don't see this is as a case of ""omg Riot is LIARS"", it's not as if there was some malicious intent behind their original promise to try and dick people out of money (obviously, given the refunds people are getting). It was just a shit decision made by a company that had no idea what their game was going to turn in to.

I, for one, am looking forward to my ~3000rp refund and to actually being able to see Pumpkin Fiddle or Steve in a game again."
"Stop talking about kids and maturity when you don't even know the reason why people are upset, kid"
"As an owner of many of the Vintage skins, this community is upset for no reason, they just think it will de-value their account."
"I for one, think that a huge amount of people wanting these skins actually want them for their exclusivity which will be lost now. Majority of those skins are quite inferior to the newer ones and their only value is exclusivity, although there are few skins with very nice splash (Kitty Kat comes to mind). I'm owner of several of those skins and I don't mind them being available again."
"I don´t have a single skin of those. I am so happy that I will be getting two Poppy skins that I always wanted. But if I were one of those guys who were around when Riot needed people the most, and helped the company make the first bucks they got, that made them grow this large... I would be fucking pissed.

It´s such a scumbag move from Riot... screwing those 200.000 first customers with a ""take your money back, now we don´t need it"" so they can get way more money from the millions that play today.

TL;DR: The owners of these skins are the guys that helped Riot when it was a small company with 50 workers in a small office. They gave them the money to become what they are today, and that made millions of players join. You can´t do that to them."
"So they ""lied"" and changed their mind. So what? People are acting like they stabbed you the back while they were fucking your mother while eating your kitten. They're pleasing more people than they're upsetting."
"Are there really that many people out there with enough naiveté to think that things skins would stay gone forever? That just wasn't realistic from the start. If you have a problem with ""false advertising"" or ""fraudulent marketing,"" trust me when I say that this ""betrayal"" by Riot Games is not going to the the biggest issue you face in life."
"The problem isn't that other people will have it. The problem is that the skins were purchased under a certain understanding that this was the only time you could buy it.

I don't care one way or the other. I have the skins I want out of the vintage lot. You come off as a little childish yourself here. Just the tone of your post screams teen. "
"Riot doesn't care for people who didn't have the skins. It's a huge gold mine waiting to be tapped into. They are running a business, they barely give a shit about whether or not you have some outdated poorly made skin. They actually get so much value from some crappy skins (let's be honest most of them aren't even made properly) just because they where rare. The only reason people even wanted those skins is BECAUSE THEY WERE RARE. Get it in your heads. Naive kids. "
"Obviously Riot is really scummy for blatantly lying to their customers. And I'm sure a number of those vintage skin purchases wouldn't have occurred had they said ""These skins will become available again in the future"" (hence the return of RP to original owners). But in line with the icon / border / whatever being 'useless', that same logic applies to the skin. The skin is useless. It's meaningless and people are taking it too seriously. Skins should be purchased as a reflection of your tastes, your humour, your vision of what the champion *should* look like. Not just because it is rare or exclusive. Buying a skin just because no one else can have it is really lame. I say, share the enjoyment with others! Don't be selfish and entitled. I, as an owner of vintage skins, don't really care that other people will own them. I didn't buy the skins because they're rare, I bought them because they're cool. Really, I am super excited to get some RP out of this!"
"You guys do understand that Riot has no obligation to compensate the skin owners, right? They could just release the skins and be done with it."
"The way I view it is:

You paid for a rare skin, you got the best out of it.
Due to high demand, it was going to be released again.
To satisfy the people who bought the skin before, they will get the RP refunded, and get an icon so they can continue to show off that ""they had it first"".


A lot of you are ignorant assholes, you're still going to have the vintage status, why is this such a big deal? Almost nobody has a lot of those skins, it's about time some more people have it. It's not like every single player will have it, and they won't be available permanently. 

I partially understand you guys, and why you feel cheated but I don't think it's right such small amount of people should have those skins, it really is a waste of them. I agree with re-releasing them temporarily."
"Sometimes I buy skins to make people jealous. Other times, I buy them to look


[FAAAAAAAABULOUS!](http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b183/Slimbrero/taric.jpg)"
"I can understand the disappointment, but people who are saying Riot is greedy are dumb. Riot does a lot for the userbase - they dump a lot of money into the LCS, which doesnt really have a revenue source to match the expenses. They're even refunding the original cost - the new cost as an offset. You didn't do anything great to get thesr skins; playing League 6 months earlier than someone else on your team is not an achievement."
"From what I have read people are mad about RIOT going back on their word for skins once again, not that others get them. In my opinion these skins all need to be super fucking cheap according to RIOT's new skin pricing. If they mark them at full price it's going to be the stupidest thing ever."
"The skins were released as legacy skins, if they would have said that the skins would never return i would see the problem. But i don't get what the problem is now."
I'm going to miss all the terrified compliments about my lolipoppy
"Every year Mcdonald's says the Mcrib is limited time only and never coming back, YET ITS BACK EVERY YEAR THE LIARS!"
The only people bitching about these skins going on sale are losers with heavy case of white whine.
"Personally i think that people who own those skins probably don't care that someone else got skin like this. I think that they care, just like me about the skin being ""exclusive"", they were for people who supported Riot from the beginning. It's just like people who have those skins earned rare achievement and now Riot wants to give the achievement for everyone, it's just stupid, those skins will lose their true value. Also Riot said that they wont be on sale again, they lied to people who gave them money and support, it's just doesn't right. "
"You're a dumbass, adults don't make fun of children. You're just another asshole with a differing point of view.

"
"It's the fact that they said that they will never again come back to the store.

Riot lied to the people who helped them out when most of todays players didnt even know"
"This is the most balanced post ever regarding upvotes and downvotes (having more than 100 votes), seems like the community is quite divided on this one."
"So basically any new limited edition skins are useless, because as soon as some new players or players who did'nt have the option to purchase them are complaining about it, they won't stay exclusive anymore, this is how it generally feels like right now."
"Personally I don't care too much about them giving the skins again, I bought it thinking it would be limited and all that but I'm not super invested in being unique... but the ""you're being selfish"" argument is just dumb. YOU are also being selfish by wanting the skin for YOURSELF. You are taking away the joy some people have of being unique. Yes we get RP and some icon thing but that's not what we originally were expecting. The returns are just not the same. 

Once again I'm fine with this and hope everyone gets the skins they want, but you guys need to understand how it makes the original buyers feel and not just tell them to get over themselves because they're being selfish; everyone is right now. Some people WILL be disappointed and rightfully so, let them be."
"1st some ppl spent hundreds of dollars for a exclusive skin and now they are fked(not me)

2nd ROit said those skin were LIMITED that's why one bought it and now Riot brakes the promise just for MONEY

Grow some maturity? go to hell"
"I'm going to be rude and say, I understand why riot is doing this. You start a game and put out a couple skins say that ""If you buy them now, you'll be the only ones with them. you'll be really cool, and you'd be showing your loyalty to a game that we're trying really hard to get off the ground."" Quite a couple buy them, maybe...500,000-1,000,000 I have no real numbers. So time goes on, those skins remain rare. Then some new players join, like...30 times the current playerbase. and they're looking at all the skins and theres just that one skin that they can't get....there taking up space, can't get it or nothing. Maybe some dudes got a boner for Veigar and has like 5/6 skins, and would buy that last one in a heartbeat. Some might call him, devoted. 

   So, its 2-3 years down the line, your games playerbase has gone up 3000% and perhaps you've lost some of that minority to time, or other games/MoBAs. And you've got new blood. These devoted people with money. They'd blow it all even if they were told the skins were coming back again, simply because they like the skin. Would you turn that money down? You could call them hitler, or fucking corporate scum or something, but we're talking about a LOT of money being raked in. AND more skin diversity. Maybe I'm not up there in the +2,500 game wins area, but I almost never seen these skins, (Though I will say the last time I saw a Pumpkinhead Fiddle was about 3 weeks ago, I was scared at the load in screen, and scared end game when he was 21/8/14 and had carried his whole team.) Beyond that one event I've seen...8 or 9 of those skins. They're far too rare. 

That said, those original devotees blindly trusting a game should be given more than a pretty cool Icon, a banner, a special art change that shows they're still special, and the money they spent of the skin. they got to get....more RP. That last part sounded sarcastic, but I mean it. Oh or you know what'd be cool? A really bad ass gold frame around the skin art itself that shows the date of purchase at the bottom. I'm serious, that'd be...well really flashy, but equally really damn awesome. 

Now for uhh added effect, umm disagree with me, annndd choo choo or something. honk honk, beep beep."
I have a few exclusive skins and I don't really care that they are re-releasing them. There are going to be people who bitch and moan about everything. Just ignore them because when you make posts like this it just gives them another place to complain.
"I like your points, but your execution was terrible.

5/10 would try again."
"There is no other way to put it, they are butt hurt. "
"OP is a retard.

Do you understand that riot lied to us ? They said they will NEVER put them on sale ever again.

Riot just wants to make more money, they're at the top, they don't care about their players since they aren't a small company anymore. And those whiny cry-babies, be fucking happy you get the same skin as someone who played years before you."
"my 2 cents 

good: i never see those skins, they are rare as shit

bad: riot said they wont sell it again.. liers"
"I understand both sides of the argument but I believe that, while Riot did go back on their word, bringing back these skins isn't that bad. I don't own any of them, so I am probably quite biased in the matter."
"Not speaking for everyone here but this is more of a matter of being a collector than ""make others jealous"". I for one own almost half of the skins that's coming back and I plan on purchasing the other half when they go on sale again. Frankly I don't have a problem with this move by Riot. I think this is actually quite nice of Riot to do. 

I'm an avid collector of various things ranging from Dolls to Cards and I figure I give some input to the other spectrum of things. The sucky part of it for me is that I'm a collector. I don't collect these skins to tell other people ""HA! I'm better than you!"". I do it because I like to collect things and it makes me happy to look at them. This move just simply devalues the way I look at my skin. But just because it makes me feel that way, doesn't mean I'm going to try to limit other people from enjoying it.

Just the way I see things. Going to get burried anyways. 
"
"Whenever someone uses the term ""hater"" I generally assume their maturity level out of ten is around a 3 or 4 at best. "
"Yeah, people are actually upset because Riot *explicitly* lied to them by saying those skins would never return to the store! Fucking immature people these days."
"Personally I hate this Riot decision. A lot.

I am saying this as a person, who doesn't own **any** of these skins, but I would love to have some (who wouldn't like to have Kitty Cat Kata or Definitely Not Blitzkrank?).

What Riot wants to do is a terrible thing to do. At the time they were selling those skins they said that it is **Limited** (i.e. never to be sold again) and now they are changing their mind? It is just flat out lying to their customers. As I said before I like some of these skins a lot but they are limited, never to be sold again, end of story. Now they are just breaking their own promises and I hope that Riot will change their opinion on that matter

**TL;DR** I don't have any of these skins but would love some. Still prefer them not to go on sale."
"Im VERY conflicted about this. These skins are relatively poor compared to the skins of the last 1,5 years. The main reason the skins were still so appealing was because the supply was low. I myself own Haunting Nocturne and Pumpkinhead Fiddlesticks. I love playing with those skins because they're quite exclusive. I feel that when they re-relase these skins they'll be A) Not up to par and B) will have that special feeling removed which made them awesome.

On the other hand I've regretted not getting Zombie Ryze, Kitty Katarina and Definitely Not Blitzcrank when I had the chance and would love to have them. However this is backed up because of their low supply.

I like that Riot is trying to compensate original skin owners with RP, however both the summoner icon and loading screen adjustment feel very lackluster."
"The skins were supposed to be ""Limited Edition"". If you actually played the game in 2010-2011 and you bought ""Limited edition"" skins to support riot, you deserve to keep the skin as ""legendary/limited"" skins. Sure we get a ICON, but, one of the reasons I bought the skin was because it said LIMITED EDITION, thus meaning not to be released again. I bought the skin for the skin, not for the icon."
"Now lets turn this into one of those ""Poor EUW, feel sorry for us"" threads."
"i can understand that these guys are mad because riot said that the skins are unique and htey are not going to be unique after they reopen them at the shop.

but some skins were released years ago when the playerbase was really low and a lot of these players with this limited unique skins stopped playing already, so the skins are kinda gone."
"Hey kid, get your head out of your ass and think before you make a post like this. The people that are hating on the sale because they already had some of these skins are totally right. Riot told them these skins would be sold for a certain time and after that they would NEVER be sold again, since Riot will be selling them again they pretty much did false advertising which is ILLEGAL! These skins were pretty much a prize for the people that played when this game was still pretty small and not as mainstream as it is now. Riot crumbled under the pressure of the community and will be putting these skins on sales regardless of what they promised in the first place! All of us that don't have any of these skins should just shut up and embrace this opportunity, the people that have these skins have all the right to be mad and these's no reason to hate them for expressing this anger.
P.S. I do not own any of the skins, but I'll be buying quite a few of them when they're on sale."
Possibly the best post I've seen in this whole discussion.  Both sides have points and anyone who tries to call the other side immature is foolish.  
"He might be immature and a little naive, but he has a point. Why is everyone so obsessed with having more than others or something others don't? You still have the icon to show you were the ones who originally owned them. 

Yes you were promised limited edition, but my bank funds were secured by the government. That didn't stop shit from disappearing from my account, and money is actually important. 

Don't get me wrong, I think riot should do more for people who have the skins already, but can we take a step back and realize we are talking about a video game? This is the same hipster garbage we see all the time. I listened to his album before he was popular. I wore those glasses before they were cool. Can't we all just accept that this is good for the community? "
"They did say it will be limited and wont be available ever. sold that to us. Now realized oh crap, we can make tons of $$$ now by releasing them again, so why not. Screw what we said earlier. Money>Ethics = Way of the world. Move along."
"This is my thinking as well.


As cool as it is that I'll have a banner for the skins I bought and an icon and all that, and EVEN that I got them for free, at the end of the day the whole reason I enjoy playing my allstar akali skin (or w/e other skin) is because it's ""rare"" and it gets the ""whoa! allstar akali!"".


Now I will probably never play with that skin again since other skins have better in game art."
"I really do agree, as a beneficiary of this, since I only started playing beginning/mid season 2. They really should reward their exclusive skin owners after going back on their word. I like the fact that we get to see quite a few of these skins in game more often as it's such great art, but I'm also a a bit disappointed. I hope they end up keeping some of the other skins exclusive to give a bit of prestige to those who have been playing since beta/season 1. "
"I'd be quite ambivalent too, but fortunately I don't own any of them.

However, arguing that a Limited Edition item only gets used by a limited amount of people is massively absurd. That's the whole point of it being *Limited Edition*."
"I'm so happy just because everybody with an old skin is losing their shit bad in the original thread. The entitlement is atrocious.

It's even funnier when they talk about ""betrayal"". For Christ's sake, grow the fuck up."
"so... I'm thinking of a limited skin only for those, who owned a limited skin. as compensation."
"This so much. It has nothing to do with maturity,  I understand Riot's thinking (money,) however, this is cheating everyone who bought these skins. If a skin is sold to people as something that would never be released it should stay that way. Riot either understands or fails to realize this was one of the major selling points of these skins. While it doesn't do anything to devalue an account it just ruins to exclusivity of owning the skins, which, is one of the main reasons people bought it."
"Riots player base wasnt anything near the size it is now, nor was LOL or MOBAs as popular.


The skins are not a car, it cant be sold later (unless you sell your entire account) the skins have no value what so ever by themselves.

Riot also has not said what the skins will be sold for (I would hope their original price, otherwise riot is just price gouging and being greedy) and they havent said what amount of RP people who already have them are getting back


And riot has said they will signify the skins that were originally bought, so if you still want to be an elitist and brag about how you were playing a game 3 years before someone else knew about it and therefore your skin is better you will have something that backs up you snubbery"
"I've never seen any of these skins ever and I've been playing for two years. As bad as it is, I feel like a good chunk of the people who bought these skins only bought them because they were going to be rare. I would love to see these skins in game more since they are clearly incredibly popular. 

I know I'll be buying quite a few of the skins when they come out though. I could really care less about it being ""limited"" or not. "
"I'm confused... why can't he??? Did he??? or are you trying to to prevent him from the annoying: OBLIGATORY FRONT PAGE EDIT: HEY MOM, STACY AND ALL OF MY FRIENDS LOLOL FRONT PAGE WHO KNEW.

I friggin hate those edits haha. "
"**""so they can at least have something for the shit riot made them go through.""**

Right...I'm sure this was an INCREDIBLY traumatic experience for you. You don't have our sympathies when you speak about this as though it were a bad break-up.

**""This is about Riot lying to us, and if they want to make it OK, they should by giving us something of a value. ""**

Now THAT is just hypocritical. People think you (when I say you I refer to everyone who is against these skins being re-releasted) are being self-entitled and whining about not being ""special"" anymore. Your counter-argument is that you don't care about the skins, but the fact that Riot lied to you. And you post something like that? It's ok for Riot to lie, as long as they make you the special snowflake once again?

God damn."
"You are so right. The thing i'm the most pissed about is that such a big company lied to me, so they could make more money, without having to make new skins. I spent real money on this."
"This is just another reworded comment about wanting to selfishly keep  your ""rarity"" for what purpose? To smother in peoples faces right? There's no trade market on League so there's no economy to destroy right? Or are u going to admit to breaking the rules you accepted to adhere to when u signed up?"
"cry more over a videogame please! CRY MORE BABY BOY CRY
LET THE TEARS FLOW"
"Same. I would love to get some of the skins, but not like this. This is just disgusting."
"which one is steve?

i too own a few ""exclusive"" skins and i don't care one bit if someone else has them.  people who think the value of their skins is tied to how many other people own them are retarded, you can't even trade the skins.  they have no value whatsoever"
No one cares the skins are available again. Everyone thinks Riot's compensation is shit though. 
"I have wanted kitty kat & snow bunny nid for so loong, but i feel that this is just greed from riot. Those skins were special for a reason but now? i will buy them but it will leave a sour taste"
"We all know that those are lies. They just want us to get jelly of their ""LIMITED"" skins. RIOT just want the majority of us to enjoy the game more."
"You put it like we are running around with signs ingame and are spamming ""hahahaha I own this skin and you don't"" which we are not doing, we are not taunting anyone, we are not rubbing it into anyones faces.

When I play my snowbunny Nidalee or Santa Gragas (only two of the skins I own but my favorites) and people in the chat are like ""oh the skin is so cool"", ""the skin is so awesome"" or ""the first time I see that skin"", which happens quite often, it obviously makes you feel good that you get acknowledged, I usually respone with a ""thanks, yeah I love it <3"".
How does that makes us assholes, its incredibly immature and unfriendly of you calling us that.

Edit: And yes we own the skins to show them off, that's what they are for, that's their purpose and that's the reason why people want to buy them even though they are not available anymore, to show them off."
"Why are there collectors in the world? Because the rarity of it has value. If it was commonly found everywhere, it would be worthless.

The summoner icon is horrible, there are many better looking ones already out so there's no reason to use it. The watermark makes the splash look retarded. Why would I want a shitty icon covering the splash art? Free RP is nothing and barely a form of compensation."
"On the other side are crybabies crying that they could not get the skin they wanted, so they cried cried and cried even more so mum-riot finally decided to let them have it."
"I think your viewpoint is very interesting because it runs parallel with my own, but on a far different track.

I own Urfwick, as an example.  I haven't seen anyone else ever use that skin.  It makes me happy to see people remark about how cool it is, and how rare it is.  It is the only reason to play Warwick these days.

If Riot resold that skin, I'd be sad.  I wouldn't be angry because everyone else would own it.  I wouldn't be sad because it had become popular.  I'd be a little sad that I wasn't able to share my story about how I bought it by mistake.  I couldn't tell them that I drunkenly bought it, thinking it was Urf.  I couldn't tell them how confused I was when I couldn't figure out what I had just purchased.  I hated it at the time.  Now, I love it and find it hilarious.

That's what would make me sad: my ability to lighten the mood and share a funny story.  With this move by Riot, I wouldn't be surprised if Urfwick hits the store in the future."
"Exclusivity only means that it's ""restricted or limited"", it doesn't mean that the skin will never be sold again.

And if this is the worst that happens to all of you in life then you'll have a great life, just remember that!"
"bad analogy, since riot is giving RP back..

so how bad would you feel if you invested money in gold, and suddenly huge gold reserves were found and the gold price went down while getting fully reimbursed for the amount you spent on your gold?"
"You could easily argue the reverse. Why do people care so much about those specific skins? You like the look of it, so you're upset you can't get it? I like Scarlett Johanssen but I'm never going to touch that even with a 10 ft pole. Just buy a different skin, it's not like riot stopped making them. It's just the garbage sense of entitlement we see all the time, can't we accept that rewarding early adopters is good for the community?

Ultimately riot broke a promise and people are upset by that, I don't see why we need to go into ""who's the bigger man"" and moral high ground arguments because those are basically impossible to settle properly."
They supported Riot when it was up and coming. Does that mean nothing? I have 0 of these skins and it still makes me upset. Can anyone still trust Riot anymore?
if you bought a skin for bragging rights you were(are) doing it wrong
"Bitch please. Kabam. If you've ever heard of the realm of the mad god, you would love Riot."
"It just means that in the future if they ever say ""LIMITED TIME ONLY"" for a certain skin we'll know that it's an outright lie, or at least it's only sincere until it becomes fiscally inconvenient for Riot. 

Like the above poster stated, you can't sell Limited Editions of something and then go sell them 5 years later, it bastardizes the whole point of the concept. "
">But would Riot rather please the million+ people who really want to get their hands on these skins, or, the 53 people who own Ice Toboggan Corki and keep it off the market so they can feel special showing it off to .5% of the players?

So youre saying Riot can sell them again after saying they wont return and saying to early supporters of the game that bought these with good intentions they can go fk themselves because they are the minority?

Theres also plenty of ppl that dont have the skins and say, the decision is bad, it was supposed to be something special.

Its just greedy for money to sell those again imo, they cant possibly care too much about the skins being seen often (and they were supposed to be rare anyway, duh). Or maybe they just cant take that ear-full anymore from whiny players that want the skins."
"I believe that Riot understands this perfectly, but they have made a business decision - that the anger this generates in the few vintage-skin owners will be quite offset by the money raised by selling the skins again to the far far larger share of players that don't have them but want them.

Also, notice how they basically said that championship riven + a few other skins are still unavailable ... for now. This means that, with their new philosophy, they will for sure be sold. Probably in late 2014. As a championship riven skin owner (the ONLY skin I own) this pisses me off immensely. When I purchased that skin I was still a student living on scholarships and loans. I purchased it nevertheless because it was now or never. Now I can afford to easily buy it 5-10 times over, but it just wouldn't be the same."
"They refund less RP than the skin would be worth now, and they let you keep something that is worth far less than it was 3 days ago. Oh yeah, and they also give you two worthless icons that nobody ever looks at, not even the owners. 

Gee. If I was one of the vintage skin owners, i would be ecstatic."
"A small number, maybe, but most of those players have been supporting the game by buying RP when League of Legends was still growing. They bought the skins trusting that League of Legends would become bigger and bigger and that they could play for several more years. Their money would not be wasted.

So while the group might be small, they are the people that made Riot what it is now.

Also, the free *shit* is indeed shit. Seeing the limited skins in the loading screen won't be special anymore and I'm pretty sure people won't care about the difference between a 'trimmed' skin and a non-trimmed skin. Also, there is no difference in-game at all. But the trim isn't my biggest concern. I don't like the fact that the refund is in Riot Points, even though refunding in real money would be reaaaaally hard. It's a game with virtual *things* to buy so receiving RP really doesn't mean anything. But that's just my opinion. "
"Because, and honestly?  I don't care at all about what you want.  It's about what was sold to me, the buy.  I *bought* exclusivity.  I supported this game when NA servers were like the EUW servers, they would crash for a week after every patch, and every weekend.  I supported this game when it was, quite literally, a piece of shit.  It was.  It was worse than DotA, and the only reason I played it was because my friends played it, and I wanted to see where it went.  It got big.  And NOW they spit in my face by saying ""hey, let's give these new kids all the cool stuff you got by dealing with us when we were a 20 person office!""  It's a kick in the nuts.  "
Oh sorry ill stop feeling lied to and betrayed by a company ove backed for 3 years.  They're hitting the most core of their playerbase with betrayal. I wish I could say its stupid but it will only make them money. All we are afterall to them is money.
" having a rare skin means that they supported Riot in the early stages by purchasing the so called ""limited edition"" skin. Riot explicitly stated that these skins were not to be resold at any point after their event. Now they give the players who supported them during these early stages a big fuck you"
"People like to show off that they are the veteran/oldest players here and there's nothing wrong with that. It was always this way in most of the MMO and other genres and it should stay this way. 

Plus it's the sole purpose of the skins - to show off that you have it and someone else don't. For some people - me including, rare things = more precious. If i see some skin appearing in 50% of the games i'm less likely to buy and use it, it loses it's purpose and it's completely pointless.

Also by doing so riot will lose many potential customers, thousands of people were buying those skins only because they were there for a limited time and were meant to never come back, now they simply won't buy it cause there is no rush anymore."
How is wanting to keep the rarity of your skins selfish? Its selfish of people to want to devalue the skins others bought to support Riot from 2011 onwards when Riot was a fraction of what it is now. We bought the skins at the time they were released due to the fact Riot marketed these skins as limited. We were given a promise that was broken when we bought these skins thinking they will be limited. 
"All of you in support of this decision Riot made keep on bringing up the word ""selfish."" Have you ever tried looking at our POV? If anything you are selfish for not caring about our side and labeling us as selfish and moving on. Of course you probably don't care because you are gaining something in this situation at the expense of the older loyal players losing something."
"I'm not going to lie, I will buy a skin or 12 but I do feel bad for those who bought it on the basis of rarity. "
"you really think Riot is doing this for the players?
Not at all for the money... noooo really?"
"oh sure, there are far worse things that can happen in life than a company lying to you and rereleasing something that was supposed to be limited. I started playing in Season 2 around the time that TSM acquired Dyrus, hence the flair, so none of this applies to me because I don't own any of these skins, though I would like to. I just feel bad for those who are longtime players of the game and think they should have something that they can own."
"How does them supporting Riot in the early days translate to exclusivity of a holiday skin collection--a set of skins that had nothing to do with being an early Riot supporter? If you want swag for playing League since the beginning, ask for Riot to release something only available to people who have been active since the beginning. Otherwise it is completely irrelevant. The skins were and still are Limited Edition. In no way does that mean they are a one-time deal. Questioning your trust of Riot over something like this is pretty pathetic."
And in return some lose the ONLY reason why you bought the skin in the first place.
"You can sell skins for money and abuse gift system. That's not about refunding RP, it's all about the feeling of being cheated, scammed. "
"They can still ""show off"" that they are the veterans with the borders to the skin.  The thing is absolutely no one cares.  If someone told me in champ select that they were in beta I'd think to myself, ""who the hell cares?"""
"""Plus it's the sole purpose of the skins""
WHAT, The sole purpose of skins is to smear them into peoples faces? The fuck, i buy them because they're fun to use and visually appealing.  

Again, League doesn't have a trade or loot system ""It was always this way in most of the MMO and other genres and it should stay this way."" Does not apply here.  You BUY the skins you do not Aquire them with grinding or trading.  You're categorizing skins as an object for envy above anything else, which I find selfish"
"People making this argument are making the same argument that things like a loved one's ashes, a family pet, or a lucky penny all can't have ""value"" to you unless you're going to sell them. You're arbitrarily limiting the definition of a word purely to suit your purposes in an argument.

I don't have a single 'limited' skin, but I can completely understand people who're upset. It's a big game and it was something to be proud of. Riot is taking that away with minimal compensation."
Why would they care whether it is against the TOS to sell the account? They get the money for selling it anyway. And the person who buys the account gets it banned.
"> the LE Skins costed the same amount as any other skin

Charizards cost as much as every other card, including Caterpie. I think it was $8 for the booster packs of 11 cards. If that's right, a 1st edition Holo Charizard still only cost $0.73, but required many *MANY* $8 purchases. Your $10 skin was and is still only worth that one-time $10 purchase.

>The type of rarity is utterly different compared to no longer on sale and monetary constraints.

While you can still find some on eBay (most still highly overpriced), Charizards are no longer printed. Those particular skins were no longer sold. Definitely similar. 

Though not as rare as the hype, there were still only a specific number printed. There was no limitation on skin quantities. Similar. Both were limited by time, though you can re-sell a Charizard. Point to LE skins.

Plenty of people have lost their cards. Plenty of people have stopped playing LOL. Both have taken hits in overall quantity remaining.

The series of Charizard changes the function of the deck. Riot doesn't sell non-nerfed champ stats, so in this sense even the least rare Charizard (Blaine's?) is more unique and rare than any LOL champion. The skin does nothing to change or improve gameplay.

Pokemon, Magic: The Gathering, Atlus, Capcom, etc. haven't refunded any money to anyone for adjustments in value, quantity, rarity, whatever. Riot is refunding RP to all remaining LE skin owners.

Considering how rarities and prices fluctuate throughout history among all things retail, this is being handled pretty awesome-like. I'm glad Riot is re-releasing them and is cool enough to give back to those who supported them. Nobody else will ever do this. Ever."
"They promised at the time the skins would never be available again. They were heavily marketed as such. 

You must admit you at least understand how it upsets people that a promise of exclusivity of a previous purchase is being broken? Saying ""It wasn't meant to be that way"" is believing whats being said *now* by Riot, rather than what was said *then*.

When a lot of us bought these skins, it was ""Buy it now before its gone FOREVER"", not ""Buy it now before its gone for awhile then we make it available again"". "
"Yeah. But still, the old team kinda wrecked it pretty bad (ammies and pets) I would say Riot has been a little better than the old team, but the new team is way more community oriented, and probably beats out Riot because Riot has a way bigger player base to deal with."
"It was also providing early support to Riot by buying these, so just because you didnt play back then, or precisely why you didnt play, you shouldnt have them."
"That is not always the case, one big example comes from Magic: the Gathering.

Back in the early days of Magic, mid to late 90s I believe, many cards were quite scarce, and had highly inflated prices.  So when they came out with a set that reprinted many of these cards, and in high quantity, it caused prices of those cards to crash, in some cases from $50 to $.50.  Understandably this pissed people off and let to the Reserved list being made, a majority of all the rares that had been made to date, and a promise that those cards would never be printed again, not even under a new name.

Despite constant outcry from the community, they have stuck to their promise and even closed up loopholes they found in the original promise."
"Riot, you betrayed my love! I no longer want to play your game anymore!"
"It absolutely is a case of Riot going back on their word.  They said these skins wouldn't ever be available again.  And now they are.  That is absolutely going back on their word.  And yes, Riot was a much smaller company when many of these skins were available, but success is no excuse for breaking your word.

And the reason you don't see many pro streamers using these skins (even when the have them) is because they aren't allowed to be used in tournaments.  The Pros tend to use skins they're allowed to use in tournaments for consistency sake.  Occasionally though, I have seen Dyrus bust out his  ""The Might Jax"" and ""Riot Squad Singed"" skins."
"Psshtt, why do we excuse our favourite businesses of lying all the time? ""Oh it's fine, they need to make money. They shouldn't care about our feelings"". Nek minute you're scrubbing crude oil off a half-dead baby seal and listening to some greenpeace chick sob into her cardigan.

BABY SEALS!"
"Ye, would be nice if riot asked us beforehand what do we think about those compensations. Personally i consider this summoner-icon ugly as hell and i do not want this ""new effect"" on my skin splash-art."
"My 3 year old sister finds it offensive, how about 1?"
Most accounts *don't* get banned though. You would have to advertise that the account had been bought and sold. 
"That's fair, and no I have no solid proof. Especially since we all understood the Terms and Conditions to read ""everything is subject to change at all times"", there's certainly no grounds of taking legal action on being upset.

It was fairly well understood by everyone I was playing with at the time to be that way though, and I feel confident it was at the very least heavily marketed and suggested to be that way.

I can vividly recall reading long threads early on in the forums over Snow Bunny Nidalee, who was released at a higher price point than anything had ever been at the time (975 I believe), but the entire justification at the time was ""Its expensive because Nidalee has two models AND we're never going to sell it again! So be an early adopter of our first big skill cap champion and show it off"" type thing.

Not to be condescending, but out of curiosity were you playing back then? If you're talking about in the last two years, then yes, they have been much more careful about their wordings, but even so they made distinctions that some would be Legacy and some would be Limited, assuring that Limited would stay locked away.

I'm not trying to be an asshole about wanting exclusivity, I just feel like individuals such as yourself are not being very understanding that players like me helped get this game where it was by purchasing these earlier skins, and we're being quite disrespected by this move. I'm not even that upset, I think the decision to do loading screen watermarks is fairly creative and mildly satisfactory for myself.personally."
"You do realize that limited stuff is not league-only right? Those people feel entitled to something that was promised to them, a limited skin and not one that gets sold later on anyway. I don't really mind myself, but I do get their frustration"
Mistletoe Leblanc was from earlier but it's a legacy skin.  Riot wasn't very careful with their naming so there's always a lot of confusion with this.  Limited skins were the ones they said wouldn't ever be sold again.  But there's also legacy skins which were taken out of the store but would still be able to come back later.
"God man could you suck corporate cock any harder?

Do you personally own shares in riot? If not congratulations you should only ever care about consumer issues. Otherwise you're betraying your own interests. 

Capitalism bitches. Understand it. Own it. 

Stop making excuses for companies that don't serve your interests. "
"here's my thing with this.


you pay 20k for the car, but how much is it worth now that it is extremely rare? 20k back when you bought it was maybe an average price, but now that car could be well worth 5-10 times that.


so not only are they giving you the old price without adjusting for how rare it is (AKA, the true value), they are starting to fabricate it again, causing whatever value it had gained to be instantly deleted."
I guess I just assumed that was a limited skin since it came out with the other limited skins. 
"Perhaps you're right, I'm a developer not a lawyer so I'm not well versed on civil suits of this nature.

I do sometimes feel like I make excuses for Riot with some of the disrespectful gestures they make, but overall I still believe they've done a lot for their player community and the gaming community as a whole, so like I said I haven't grabbed a pitchfork or a lawyer.

Just a bit saddened some players are ripping apart the people that this actually hurt... Its kind of cruel of them."
"If we assume that you have as much of a chance of being any of the highest to lowest people in a team (so the same chance of being the highest as being the lowest, for example), then randomised pick order is literally the same as having the highest person be first pick.

I mean, statistically, over time you will average being 3rd pick (unless you are literally top of the server levels of MMR like faker) if you did MMR based pick orders. If Riot had never announced this change, no one would have noticed."
"Why? like seriously, give me one reason why. Do you honestly believe that the dude with ~20 more MMR than you knows how to pick ban better?"
"Why?  It just encourages toxicity.  ""I got first pick, that means I'm the best player on the team, if something goes wrong, it's everyone' fault but mine."""
"Why? I'm against this 100%.

1) Players are either falsely given a sense of superiority or players feel like a burden/weaker immediately. Causing tension and a lack of camaraderie. (We only get enough of that in game, don't need it within 5 seconds of champ select).

2) Lets say you want the highest mmr role to carry this game, maybe it's you! Do you want them to ALWAYS be first pick and have a much harder time in game due to a higher probability of being countered in lane.

3) This is more of an observation and opinion. I noticed that the first picks in the old system felt that at this point they needed to carry since they were the ""best"" on the team. So their bans would just get rid of champions that countered their favorite champion or play style. Instead of banning champions that are FOTM for the team."
"no, this is one of the few modifications riot has made to the ranked environment that actually makes any sense whatsoever"
"Okay,let me explain my opinion on

"The mmr based pick order makes no sense. You are matched within +/- 50 mmr or less of your mmr, the difference between the highest mmr player and lowest mmr player is very frequently less than a single game.

And in cases of high challenger and duo queues it was abusable."
"People thinking that the MMR based pick order was better need a reality check. The difference in MMR for most games is completely negligible and provides more opportunities for toxicity than getting the best players their roles. Do you really think the guy with 1250 mmr is much better than the guy with 1200 mmr?

I could just as easily say the 5th pick is the best player in a random silver solo queue game because they might have been on a losing streak because his internet has been shitty recently, but he recently go a new provider and will wreck this game to make up for those past losses from packet loss. I could also discover that first pick might of had his cousin playing for him the last few matches and he really is the worse of the group.

MMR between the 10 players (unless a duo queue with two players of vastly different MMR compared to their elo) has very little impact on a game for the average player. While the sense of superiority of the higher picks and toxicity is something I saw countless times if the 4/5th pick gave first blood in a solo lane in the old system."
No. There's less toxicity when people aren't judging their teammates from the very beginning.
"You're really gonna make a ""riot pls"" post without even pretending to give an explanation as to why?"
"PROs:  ?, up to you to argue that with me - i cant be fucked to argue against myself at the moment

CONs: 

- Creates an illusion of higher skill difference than actual reality
- Might bring back the toxic environment in champion select   
I'd say this has to be much less of a problem at the moment, however I only am one player and shouldn't count as a source for this point
- 'Dont fix whats not broken'  - Champion select works pretty great at the moment, the only personal bummer is being first pick, then someone dodges and you end up with for example last pick. Could obviously happen the other way around too, and this one's mostly subjective. 
- 'People use lolking, lolnexus, op.gg  (and all other websites) anyway'    
That statement implies what exactly? There's a huge decrease (but that might be because I play in diamond 1, so most people here tend to stay away from those kind of websites). And even so what?"
"Honestly I agree with the MMR pick order, sometimes in OCE challenger players get matched with Diamond 5s, the disparity is huge, I sometimes go in games not knowing that there are Challenger players on my team and pick whatever then end up feeling guilty and underperform, I'd rather that the higher skilled players getting their picks before I do so that there's less pressure overall."
"I prefer MMR based pick order, but random pick order is only annoying if the first pick is one of the least skilled players on your team."
and what if you are the highest mmr on your team but prefer counterpicking to the enemy team comps rather than picking into matchups?
Shit i thought it suppose to be random? Ive been getting fuking last 2 pick multiple of games..so i dont know wtf rito was working on...not fair..i rather take my chances with mmr..
"didnt we all have a losing streak for like 10 games?
and with the mmr order we would probably lose way more games cuz we cant get any of our roles or a carry role.
and i dont want boosted ppl to be first pick tbh."

Changing the pick order won't do a single thing to fix whatever problem you hope it will fix. Random is better IMO.
So when I have a bad day you want to force me into the support role every game and get an even worse MMR because I can't play support?
"No, I didn't like being last pick just because I was in a higher-than-normal MMR game. 'No ur last pick ur shit.'
The amount of times I read that..."
"I don't know why people assume higher MMR makes you better than someone else. The pick order before said ""this guy is the best on the team no matter what"" when jonny over here could be better but has 20 less MMR so the system assumes they're worse. Its a toxic system."
please no back then i got scared to be first pick cuz then i knew i was better than 4 people but im bad :(
"I bet if riot did this, this sub would be filled with low mmr whiners crying about always being last pick."
Why? What is the point? As if the 50 mmr you have higher than someone else makes you better equipped to ban or means you should have higher role priority. The difference in solo queue mmr between players usually means absolutely nothing and pick order should not be affected by it.
"I agree, it's really messed up at times. Especially when you get a duo one is plat 1 but the other is gold 5 and absolutely terrible yet gets adc and you are stuck trying to support him as he predictably feeds."
"Lazy, unoriginal suggestion that is never going to happen.

0/10

Rage more because you lost a promo series while last pick, nerd."
"It's very sad how people still use the excuse of ""Why? The difference between first and last pick is minimal anyways"". No you goddamn bandwagoners without opinion that just quote whatever riot says, the difference is not always minimal. You seem to forget that not everyone plays on freaking Gold ELO and on the top of the ladder the MMR difference between first and last pick can be ridiculously high. I've had countless 4-5 AM or early morning games being 400-600 LP on Challenger and getting matched with D3-D2 players in my team. Tell me that this is minimal. Let alone DuoQ."
"Can we stop upvoting post that just demand something and don't offer description of the problem explaining why the problem is a problem, a solid argument, or a better idea."
"A few points of MMR doesn't matter. If you are close enough to be on the same team you are close enough for random pick order.
On a side note with the old system I heard a ton of people saying they were always last pick, with the new system I hear it just as much. Babies gonna find something to cry about. "
"If this gets implemented, all we're ever gonna here is ""First pick im higher mmr than you noob stfu scrub"" = Less team communication/Play.    
I remember before this randomized pick order, threads on reddit were like ""Plz remove mmr based pick order""    
Sometimes some people just can't have what they want."
"basically all it changes is when two people duo queue, the one with highest mmr doesn't get first pick to carry more easily, while he's already matched with weaker people than him. I don't see where the problem is."
"At the end of the day just because your MMR is a little bit higher than somebody it doesn't justify getting higher pick order.. Everybody in that game is relatively the same skill so pick order is irrelevant.

Also it just makes the first pick person think they are some sort of god and can trash talk everyone else because they are first pick. This way everything is even."
im in bronze dude we need this back let me ban all my champions i cant play against
Then whenever you duo with someone one of you is ALWAYS first and the other is ALWAYS last. Shit idea.
"This is the least content I've seen in a ""Riot please"" post. Why is this allowed on the sub without literally any reasoning or explanation? This post is only a ""Riot please."""
At least give your reasons if you're going to ask Riot for something.
"I want this back in a way, but also I do not.
The main reasons I want this back is the kids in pick ban crying, saying call order > pick order now because the pick order is random. If the pick order was changed to MMR, not much would really change, but it would definitely some good attitude adjustments to some solo qers"
At the begin I didn't like this random pick order. But now I want riot to keep it.
"I honestly don't see why it would be beneficial to bring back MMR based pick order? Like I cannot think of ANY reason as to why we need it back. It just allows toxicity in champion select.


Before they changed it there were multiple times where someone higher pick order than me would say ""Well I'm higher MMR so I'm obviously the better player so I'm going (insert lane here)"". Which is bullshit because we wouldn't have been playing together if our MMR/skill level was different. Randomised pick order actually helps the team with negotiating who goes where as the toxic ones can't fall back on the ""I'm better"" argument."
"Clear as day, but there are just lots of people who rage at this game and always look for something to blame. Blaming the current MMR/queue system is the easiest way to do it, because they aren't offending anyone."
"If you're losing the majority of games when you're ""forced"" into support, you're a fucking shit support and should learn the role so you're not also negatively effecting your AD's lane phase. "
"Yep, back when there was MMR based pick order, the first pick guy would sometimes act like he was the team captain or something like that and arguments and report threats would start if someone dared to disagree with him. Randomized picks prevented this from happening."
">implying tons of people don't already use lolking or na.op.gg the second someone else calls their role so they can say ""yeah I'm lower pick but you're 2 divisions below me and on a 3 game loss streak"""
"It also allowed the tilting toxic morons the troll ban and not give a shit about what the team wanted form the ""get go""."
I like the part where nowadays people just ban whatever they got destroyed by in the previous game they played
"You are theoretically about the same MMR if you get matched up with your teammates. The only time that wasn't true was with Duo queues. And in the case of the duo queues, it would give duo queues the advantage of being in charge of bans and first pick."
"The problem is when people start to duo with wide gaps. I.e Gold 5 duo with a platinum and the Gold 5 now gets first pick. the gold being used to banning x champs bans the same champs that maybe arent usual bans in platinum  or higher gold. Then they get first pick and play whatever they want. Problem is, as first pick you are VERY likely to get counter picked and so we have the worst player picking a champ and getting reasonably counter picked. This usually results in a heavy defeat. Whereas the mmr system would attempt to solve this by letting the 'better' players pick whatever and would be more experienced to deal with counter picks. This is all just theoretical and i know people will still probably lose no matter how good. It's just the principle behind mmr that is MUCH better and MORE logical. Other than making everyone 'happy' which it doesn't, random pickorder is just a bad idea. "
">  The reason Riot removed this is so people learn to trust each other and no assumptions are made.

Trust each other in Solo Queue, top lel. Until I reach the complete top there's no way I can trust anyone. Every single game it is never enough to win your lane as others will lose theirs or set you back in other motions, such as refusing to objectives. As you move up it'll get slightly better, sometimes not. But until the point people can have actual conversations(Probably around high plat) there's just no way to trust each other. Giving the first pick to someone whose used to playing support because he/she is almost always last or second last pick is quite stupid, sometimes they don't want to trade for you or sometimes they decide to try out new things in lanes they're not used to instead of in normals. What is the sanction for this? Your LP or your win/loss in ranked.

I have no problem with a person losing his/her lane but in the game if you refuse to fix it or try or perhaps listen to advice, than sorry the 9/10 cases where this happens are not enough for me to trust anyone in Solo Q. Just remove this stupid idea about random order, MMR was most realistic for a win."
"And then you end up losing your main role to a guy who is 8 divisions below you because he is duoQ and lucked himself above you in the pickorder. Sorry, but that's stupid. Very stupid."
"The reason it was removed was that it fucked up duos - you would either get 1&5 picks if there was a big difference in your elos/mmrs or 4&5th picks if they were close, which basically punished ppl for going duo with ppl in their elo range."
"Pick and ban phase is a lot better now aswell, i can probably get my prefered role (mid) 80 85% of the time just by asking it, even when im last pick unless someone asks me for X reason. It also seems to be less pre-game raging and flaming becouse of picks."
"I'm getting tired of all these Riot, pls begging. How does this rubbish get to frontpage..."
"> If Riot had never announced this change, no one would have noticed.

duo queue"
"Also, Riot tightened the MMR differences between team members."
"> If Riot had never announced this change, no one would have noticed.

This is not a valid point. Just because they don't annouce it doesn't mean it's right to do so. For example, what if they stopped announcing subtle nerfs? Over time these will accumulate and noone would notice. And the hate for randomized pick order is not based on statistical disadvantage, rather, it's the fact that someone less skilled than you, albeit slightly, is choosing their role before you do."
"> If we assume that you have as much of a chance of being any of the highest to lowest people in a team (so the same chance of being the highest as being the lowest, for example), then randomised pick order is literally the same as having the highest person be first pick.

I'm sorry  but this doesn't make any sense. The problem with random pick order isn't that you don't have the same chances of being 1-5 pick. The difference is that players that have lower MMR than you get to pick above you therefore get your main role."
"It's not about YOU being first pick. It's literally about the highest mmr player being first pick. You want the statistically best player on your team to get one of his best roles. And, also important, you want him to control the bans."
But I can't feel superior to everyone below me because I'm 6 higher mmr than them now.
"It's annoying when teammates ban something like a taric then later on the game I find out that they only have 9 games played in rank

"
"Honestly #3 is better than banning fotm champs. FOTM champs usually have relatively low winrates (unless they're really easy to play like Maokai and Tristana), and as long as you ban your counters you can usually carry (depending on your role).

I can't remember the last time I've seen a Yasuo or Zed carry. However, I've had Ammumu's and Warwicks single-handedly win the game. It's really about what you've seen win/lose games in your elo. It may sound stupid but banning Ammumu, Blitz, Warwick are statistically better bans than Zed, Yasuo, Nid. If you're an adc main and can't lane against blitz, banning blitz would be a better ban than Nidalee, in every way (both for you and your team)."
"OMG YOU NOOB! I'M CHELLANGER 3 SMURF, CAN'T CARRY THIS S.... JUNGLER NO GANKS, SUPPORT NO WARDS, ADC NO FARM STFU YOU NOOB! (by 1/4/3 Zed) [ps. yes, note with chellanger 3 is real ;] its really makes my day)"
"So you're telling me if a plat 5 duo'd and ended up with Diamond 1 players, he should determine the bans, and take a D1's lane?"
"i was playing ranked earlier, and i can play everything decently, but jungler is by far my worst. so i say ""anythign but jungle"", and they make me jungle then complain about how i wasnt applying pressure. seems legit"
Thought I was the only one. I barely care what is banned or what role I play.
"Which only happens when two extremely unevenly skilled players duo queue and and the worse player invited, which happens practically never."
Yes but you guys are 0.01% of league's communauty so nobody gives a fuck
"playin with a duo partner increases the total MMR of the enemy team, Riots way of making the teams equal. deal with it. its also a TEAM GAME, so playing with partners shouldnt be frowned upon"
"OR else, he will quit the game. Think about it, if everyone that upvoted this thread left, Riot would lose a fraction of a tenth of a percent of their playerbase!"
"When you have a duo on your team it is. Last pick is the low ranked part of the duo, and I guarantee the difference is significant. 

""Nah man, I'm stuck in insert_elo_here because noobs""

No, you belong there. And now you are playing ADC while rushing BT in my promo series because you arbitrarily have 2nd pick. Thanks duo queue."
I just had a game where second pick was a first time ranked player with half a mastery page and random runes in low gold/high silver. I've never wanted mmr based pick back so bad
"Yeah, but someone with their head shoved so far into their posterior that they act like an ass because they perceive themselves to be so far above the rest of their team, isn't going to change based on whether or not it's true.

Verbosity bitches."
"> so they can say ""yeah I'm lower pick but you're 2 divisions below me and on a 3 game loss streak""

People seriously do this?"
"To me the big upside would be I'd save time checking out accounts to find if anyone is 5 divisions lower than everyone else. Now no longer infinite divisions lower than anyone else possible thank god due to ranked duoq restrictions, I just wish the restrictions were harsher. Purely selfish of course since I never duoq and I don't like the concept much."
"And he always gets to ban Garen, Galio, and Gangplank so he can face the OPs. I think it is smart, because you should prepare in case they get through."
"Other people have said basically this, but except in weird cases like duo queues the difference between the highest and lowest elo on a team actually won't be statistically significant. If it weren't, matchmaking wouldn't be working properly. "
"Before the change, just as often as not the 'high mmr' guy would get his role.. and suck badly costing us the game.

Everyone has good and bad games and just because your mmr is 10 higher doesn't mean that you can do whatever you want and to hell with your team."
"I always looked at it from another angle, something like ""I got first pick, fuck bans""."
"So why isn't it still implemented at the top of the later?

Right now Masters has fucked things up massively, the average skill level in Masters is awful, there are plenty of people in Masters who were NEVER above like 50LP in D1 and there are also plenty of people who were 90LP+ and the difference between low D1 and high D1 was huge.

Right now Masters has by some distance the biggest skill gap out of every league in the game and it's really messed up.

The skill level of Master is below what high D1 was now."
Because it fucking sucks for duos that aren't botlane
"Does it matter, he'll be somewhere in the game no matter what. Most likely he'll get shit on less if he's comfortable than if he's forced to fill."
"I wouldn't mind the weakest player in the game taking his best role. Your team is only as strong as your weakest link. And I think plat 5 players know who to ban.

"
"Okay, so replace bronze 4 with 850 mmr, and replace bronze 5 with 800 mmr. your mmr and your actual skill level are just as disparate as your division and your skill level. 
What i'm saying is, that correlation between mmr and skill level isn't high enough to justify someone getting to ban or getting priority pick. "
Duo queue fucks that up a lot. There is no reason for 1000 elo player to be higher than the 1500 one.
"Well now the silver 5 that's duo with a gold 1 can get first pick and take whatever he wants instead of automatically being forced into the role nobody else on the team wanted. (Not always support)

Say you are gold 2, and are a top lane main, would you be okay with being forced to last pick support while a silver 5 gets to take top lane and ends up allowing the enemy top to easily snowball into mid game."
It's not always small difference. In cases where someone duos with someone significantly lower who hosted the game they have a 40% chance of being the ban/pick guy. Someone gave the example of a plat duoing with a gold V. If the gold V first picks mid and gets countered you are at a huge disadvantage than if he had last pick and at least wouldn't get countered if given mid. 
Of course man I never said that this shouldn't happen. Obviously people don't want to wait 10 hours in que until 9 other challengers decide to play. But when this happens random pick order can cause problems. It really sucks being at that point losing your main role to someone who is 500 MMR below you.
Idiots will never run out of things to be stupid about.
"You fucking suck yea i got 12mmr more than you hahhaha you will be plat 5 forever!

1 week later im plat 3, the guy is still plat 5 xDD"
was so much worse when they let people queue without restriction. gold 1 was a pain in the taint with plat 3's duoing with silver 5 players. silver 5 hard locks syndra goes 0/15 with the rest of the game being gold 2 - p 3
"This reminds me of a comment in a recent thread on this matter. Someone using an example scenario where he can play role X well and role Y adequately and the other player who is left to pick can play role X adequately and can't really be counted as a player on the team in role Y. He then goes on to argue that the old system was so much better because ""back then I had 100% chance to get my role and now it's only 50%.""

Just mindblowing how he can't see the stupidity in his statement. Rather playing the game 4v5 than giving up his precious role as ""I CAN CARRY!""  It's also not too hard to guess that his perceived superiority comes from just assumptions, even if he doesn't know the MMR of the players on his team. I mean, sure, you can do such deep analysis on info that lolnexus provides you with and based on that one game you played with him..."
"cocksuckers do this, it actually kills the team before the game starts. "
"Played a game yesterday with p1/d5 players where the jungler on my team was p3 with 80% winrate over 70 games.

I don't know if he was drunk or had a really bad game but he towerdove twice in horrible fashion giving up first blood and buffs on the first one and then he kept making horrible plays. Enemy team snowballed super hard and he started whining about ""being done"" and game being lost until our botlane who was winning hard told him to shut up. Basically everyone else on the team was really determined to turn it around and we did and won in the end (helped that they had really bad scaling comp and started to fuck around with their huge lead).

If you go by his winrate it seems that guy is smurfing or at least belong in high diamond yet he was by far the worst player in that game so I'd say there are no guarantees a higher rated player will always do better.

Then again he might always have paid someone to elo-boost his account. His performance was so far from what I'd expect that I'll be keeping an eye on the progress of his account for this reason out of curiousity."
"Where would you find evidence of the players' real MMR other than things like lolking score and league placement? We all objectively see vast differences in skill in our actual games, and to some degree that must be reflected in MMR.

I don't quite get what you're saying -- are you arguing that MMR is not connected to skill (skill, meaning in the sense of contribution to win or loss) and therefore shouldn't be used to determine pick order, or are you arguing that the players in the game will have very similar MMR?

The first hypothesis that you've brought up is not testable -- if you argue that MMR is independent from skill then it essentially means that MMR is meaningless, since it is meant and designed as a measure of skill (once again skill meaning contribution to win or loss).

Having myself played numerous games in soloqueue across 2 different accounts, have personally experienced a difference in player ability from one league to another and in situations where my MMR should have increased a lot or dropped a lot I notice that I'm matched against people from different divisions and leagues on average. So there is a good statistical argument against both of your claims. Have a nice day."
"The two things they should do are:

1) MMR based pick order for challenger+ (possibly master+)

2) MMR based pick order in duo queues (so if a duo gets 1st and 3rd place, the higher MMR gets 1st. If duo gets 3rd and 5th place, the higher MMR gets 3rd.)

MMR based pick order outside of those cases is just stupid."
"And most people that I see duo talk about the picks and bans together. The higher MMR person is mostly the one doing them.

Before you had ""not letting last pick get mid"" and then people locking in carries because they had a false sense of superiority."
"maybe on NA, but on smaller servers it's quite frequent to have a tiers worth of mmr between the highest ranked and lowest.

eg. Plat 5, Gold 5/Dia 4, Challenger

and this isn't just one off occurrences, this is in a substantial amount of games. "
...and while going 0/15 they flame those poor goldies about how bad they are and that they know nothing.
"Yeah wtf, why would you sabotage any chance at teamwork before the game even starts? Nevermind, it's soloq dumb question."
There is no way to know what the difference in MMR actually is since riot doesn't expose that to the client unless you actually mean lp or lolking score.
"Yea but it gives people a sense of superiority because their MMR might be 10, 20, even 50 higher. In reality though, you can't determine a skill difference by that little of a number. It could change on any given game. So when Riot changed it, they removed w/e negligible skill difference people liked to think existed, and also removed a stimulus for people to be toxic in champ select.

Matchmaking already matches you with 9 other people around your skill level. There's no point in ordering beyond that based on minute differences."
"Yes it does. He can't say ""I'm first pick so I'm better than all of you noobs"". 

"
"I just came myself. But them again, we are all stupid in our own way"
"Being fifth pick is my favourite, 0 responsibilty, I don't even have to worry about calling a role."
I think it's unrealistic to expect everyone to be proficient at every role. You have 4 other team mates. If you bring 4 roles to the table and the other 4 people point blank refuse to pick up that role then they're the real assholes.
"so change it so in a duo queue, the higher MMR always gets the higher pick.

Problem solved, and no need to put MMR ranking anywhere else."
Pretty much as they are incapable of following simple instructions from the G1 like 'ban morg' =)
"How is it better?  If they're duo'ed with a much higher level player, the higher level player will likely tell them what to ban.  Plus, not like S5 players ban Bronzodia still."
"I've played league since early 2010 and followed it since it was first available outside of Riot (my brother was in the first betas and has been playing since).

Yea, they may be assholes in other ways, but it removes a sort of stimulus for the behavior. I run into less assholes nowadays than I did before randomized picks."
"I wasn't strongly disagreeing with you. Just pointing out that there already exists a system for people to control situation 2), and mentioning one reason MMR based pick order is not the best solution regardless of level of play."
"Yea, but people don't like that apparently. I myself have never had problems with low-end duos banning and picking terribly."
"Honestly, I don't see why that's much of a problem.  If I were to have a duo that are vastly different in my game, I'd much rather have pick something they're more confident and familiar with early, rather than them being forced into something they're unfamiliar with.  Obviously, it isn't ideal, but possibly they'd be less dead weight.  I don't see why higher MMR should essentially force lower MMR farther down on the totem pole in picks.  Just makes it harder to climb for everyone."
"I'm not disagreeing that the enemy team is just as likely to have the issue. However, there is no need for either team to have the issue. We could just as well have a 10% chance of having a bronze 5 on a team each game to mix things up without a net gain or loss, but obviously it doesn't have to be that way.

There is a disadvantage in getting first pick when you are noticably lower in that you are the most likely person to be counter picked (and since they are lower, least likely to be able to deal with it) on your team. That is a serious disadvantage that need not exist with mmr based order. 

Like the other guy said, there could be a code that it is mmr fixed for just the duo to avoid the problem. "
">There is a disadvantage in getting first pick when you are noticably lower in that you are the most likely person to be counter picked

Even remotely significant MMR differences are only really possible with duos, and as I think I have explained before, that situation is very easy to avoid.

>counter picked (and since they are lower, least likely to be able to deal with it)

Comfort picks matter more than counter picks. And since it's the lower MMR player's main role, they're likelier to do ok at it than if they are forced to an off role.

>That is a serious disadvantage that need not exist with mmr based order.

I don't think it's nearly as serious a disadvantage as you think and I do think it's far more harmful to give people a pecking order to enforce.

>Like the other guy said, there could be a code that it is mmr fixed for just the duo to avoid the problem.

I'm pretty sure that Riot's current algorithms already work so that duos win on average exactly as many games as everyone else."
"Am I the only one who is completely sick of this NA vs EU thing? Competition and rivalry is good, but fuck, this is getting out of hand from my POV. It's currently allowing the dumbest people to cuss at the other region and it's somewhat accepted to show racism. I know Twitch chat isn't the most relevant example, but it's still quite scary what you can read there. More easily influenced people can develop bad habits from that.

I personally watch both EU and NA, not so much the other regions because I need to sleep and keep on with my life I guess, but this shitfest here is really grinding my gears."
"You can't take 1 match and assume this true over the whole timeframe. More over the time slot Thursday for the FNC vs OG is actually quite good, it's the time slot as a whole may not be as good. The kids that watch these matches and get a good portion of the views, are FAR more likely to be busy on at 4pm on a Saturday rather then 7 or 8 on a Thursday. Simply put, the majority of the people that bring views in, are going less likely to be busy at 7 or 8 on a Thursday, then 4pm on a Saturday. In fact, if you look into prime time hours (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time), you'll see that Saturday is actually considered a bad time slot, hence why no major shows play on Saturday or Sunday, and even Friday is losing it's viewership in it's prime time hours. 

So, not to be a complete ass, but your comparison is very flawed."
"wow


relevant


looks like people try to turn everything into a EU x NA war, even something as stupid as a 20k viewer difference rofl 


who gives a shit, that doesn't mean anything


NA watches EU LCS, EU watches NA LCS"
Why do people make posts like this? Who gives a fucking shit which had more viewers? How tf did this make top page wtf
"lol this war between NA and EU... pathetic, brainless and immature."
Why does it always seem that EU fans starts the EU vs NA bullshit on this subreddit. 
"Should I give any fucks about this? 

If you are so willing to compare your dick to another one just because you lack enough self confidence to live on, gratz, it sucks to be you then. "
Can someone explain to me why this even matters? So confused...
"This is no surprise. EU has more players and a bigger general population and it isn't even close so not sure why this is even a thing.

NA viewership is just worth more to Riot. Riot main HQ is in NA, not EU so it makes sense that they are bias towards NA. Riot is a company, they need to make money. They make more money in NA than from EU. 

Viewers doesn't = money. Most people run ad blocks anyways (not even sure if Riot runs ads). 

Yes, EU has more viewers, to no surprise, but Riot is a NA company, so expect it to revolve around NA. 

If you really have a problem with when EU LCS is broadcasted, you don't have to watch it. Watch the VODs, you can even skip through the zzz moments. Not sure why people are making a big deal out of nothing. And if you are one of those little kids who need to talk in twitch chat to watch the game, I'm not sure what else to say. RIP. "
"I don't think one game of viewership, and then taking a weekend of games where EU faced Korea and NA didn't play is all that telling.  Come back to me when the spring splits over and you've compiled total numbers for both sides. As dumb an argument as it is."
"this is one of the dumbest posts ever....NFL playoffs, EU can't watch NA but NA can't watch EU cause of timezones, what ignorance.

EDIT: NA CAN* watch EU"
"I don't understand most of reaction at all...
Do you guys realise that EU will only get BO2 with 2 stream on thursday and friday ?
In riot mind (at least what they said) it's because of this ""NA gets more viewers"" statement, which is false.
To me this not is not AT ALL a NA vs EU shitpost, just a fact."
"WHO CARES?!?!  This is literally the stupidest circle jerk post I have ever seen.  Watch NA if you want.  Watch EU if you want.  Just shut up about it.  By your logic we should all just bow down to the LCK and LPL gods because they have the most viewers by far, fuck every other region."
In before this thread is removed cause people mass report it due to salt
"Well, TSM and CLG keep disappointing their fans. So no surprise there."
"Nothing beats free food, beer, and football with the family. Sorry LCS"
Just really fucking stupid. People grasping at straws at this point.
This shit only ever happens in the morning I wonder why
"It'll prolly get even worse when the formats switch. Won't be as easy to watch all games since there will be ones on at the same time or whatever. Ull have to choose and watch some VoDs later, but people will still compare I'm sure. Can't we as a community just be happy about viewership as a whole, and that Worlds is still growing despite all the bullshit other games throw at us about dying lol."
I hate it when some random idiot on reddit stir´s up the whole shit from the beginning just so he can fap to some triggered NA/EU people.
Wait EU starts in the evening for EU people? Wtf I coulda watched na if it didn't start while I was working at 12. 12 pm on a Saturday is no where near primetime for na people.
"The FNC vs OG timeslot is quite good ? Most of the people are still on their way home from work/school at that time.

I could only watch the last 5 minutes."
"> not to be a complete ass

Why not, his entire ""argument"" is ass"
"Well, you have to link the post with the controversy we had a couple of month ago on why NALCS will always be on week-ends and EULCS always Thursday/Friday (some people arguing that it'll result in less exposure, worst viewing experience for EU fans). And one of the arguments presented (by a rioter even if i'm not mistaken) is that they did it because NALCS had more viewers or something like that.

edit: if you add this the controversy on bo3vsbo2 (ie more games for NALCS etc) you can understand that a portion of the EU scene felt disregarded (not equally treated) by Riot. Thus these kind of posts."
"This isn't part of the ""war"". EU LCS had the weekends in S3, in S4 it changed ""and it will change every season"". S5 weekends for NA, same for S6. And in summer, friday will be both EU and NA."
"Because that way, if NA tries to answer back, they just have to comment ""stfu salty NA wildcard region try to reach semis, DAE 0-10 XDDD"" or ""we're just getting revenge from season 4 u guys totally deserve it"" while they also did it the 3 seasons before.

It's basically a win-win situation for them."
"Probably because most EU fans are pissed off with how they get treated compared to NA fans by Riot so vent their anger on reddit.

With that said I see NA fans doing it just as much as EU fans, both do it all the time."
No we didn't? Why would anybody outside of the US give a shit about American football?
OG vs FNC was in the morning on a weekday in NA. This argument works both ways. NA matches are prime time for EU in the weekend.
"also i couldn't watch EU lcs cuz of garbage timing + weekday.

im pretty sure alot more ppl had troubles watching FNC-OG

while CLG-TSM had perfect timing for EU and ok timing for NA"
Your 100% wrong. NA has more viewers usually the timing just collided with NFL.
"Your argument seems a bit weak. if I follow what you say: Riot is a company, thus they want to make money. So they would want to focus on their bigger market (EU - more players - wider pc gaming tradition) as they'd make more money. No? 

(I have no problem with the broadcast hours personnaly as I prefer to go out the week-end, but your argument seemed weird to me)"
You gotta look at average viewer numbers. OP's statement is inaccurate because he is willfully ignoring all the evidence to make his point. EU LCS numbers plummeted after the first game.
"Thats because one went 5 games and one went 3-0. People wanted to see OG beat the undefeated FNC, meanwhile, i doubt most eu fans gave a shit about CLG doing well agains a slumping TSM. "
"I want bo2. for all regions, bo3 is boring as hell to watch."
What ad revenue does Riot get from streaming? They don't even play ads.
"You missed the point. People argued that they put NA games on weekends because they had more viewers, which is not true."
"It's not as stupid as you might think, given that there are large arguments about NA having the prime viewing time on the weekend as opposed to EU which has midweek matches. If EU is still matching and beating NA figures while it's at a disadvantage then there's logic to say that Riot should be giving more attention to the more ""popular"" region by viewer count."
2 and 12? Wtf are you living in a world that Victoria 2 was real and every small country ceased to exist?
"NFL Playoffs draw about 1/4 viewers in the USA. Plus Saturday mid day are not really great viewing time.

It's not an excuse, it's just tv viewing habits over the last 20 years."
This si baseless assumption that OP just proved wrong in one instance. What recent data do you have to back this up? Preferably something that you did not pull out of your ass.
Fucking hate these kinds of responses. way to disregard everyone who disagrees with you.
"This shit only ever happens in the morning.  Topics about it least.  Sure some comments bring it up at night when EU is asleep but never these backhanded subtle topics that are meant to spark this shit.

I'm fucking sick of it.  This place is the WORST in the morning as an NA resident"
"I'm getting there... as long as it doesn't get worse. The worse for me is all the place it takes, it basically kills any good conversation or subject that could otherwise be brought up, since it's way better to make it about which region has the most viewers, or the most Korean players or whatever. "
Gonna jump on the bandwagon here and contradict that. I was able to watch EU pretty easily as a college student. Even during the summer at work I had games playing on my phone in the middle of the day. There's a ton of NA influence on EU LCS
"Did you realize that NA games start on 1:00 pm local time? how should anyone from na be able to watch it on weekdays ?

Better think next time b4 making a stupid statement.

And even if you want to have both play at weekends.. 

You sit there and watch 10+10 straight games on your free days? Probably not."
"They can maybe give NA one split not on the weekdays, but we don't know how that'd effect viewer numbers in general. Thats the thing that nobody seems to talk about or keep in mind, instead we just try to shout about fairness.

We talk about right and wrong, whats fair (read: convenient) for my region and so on. We don't talk about how the risk outweighs the reward when it comes to shaking things up.
 
As keep in mind it'd be swapping not only the regions but the timeslots. You can't just randomly decide to hold the EU LCS 3 hours later and the NA LCS 3 hours earlier after all. Thats a different breed of problems as now its 'what are we competing with'.

Rocking the boat when you don't have to and its not necessary is kind of stupid for the business perspective. They have close to nothing to gain by doing this and they could fuck up tremendously.

This isn't me saying 'stop bitching EU' its me going 'If you want it to happen work that shit out with extensive data/evidence as opposed to just trying to hail mary'. I work from home and watch both leagues whenever the hell I feel like it, whether it be live or vod don't matter to me. "
"Friday/Saturday are death slots in US

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_night_death_slot"
That might be part of why EU LCS runs during the week. American TV is dead on the day during the weekends
"??? You get of work at 23.00 thats your fault then.

"
The only reason the NA views were so low because of NFL playoff games.
"For this time at least, it's because EU fans are the one getting fucked by the schedule."
"The majority of EU fans doesn't give a shit. It's just always the same salty people who post about this shit.  
And tbh NA has the same salty people on their side.  
I can't count the ""EU is trash"" threads when H2K lost the first game to C9 at IEM."
"NA LCS numbers fell quite heavily aswell though. You can't just include that fact for EU, and then willfully ignore the same fact for NA. That's just straight up manipulation/lies"
"Back then TSM almost managed to lose vs TDK really hard, which were arguably the worst team in the NALCS at that point^(only contested by tsm amiright)"
"I mean they usually do. Just not during the NFL playoffs. 

Riots main demographic is also one of the main demographics for NFL football which has the highest ratings of any American show."
"If someone argued that Saturday is ""prime"" viewing time in NA then they are confused or stupid.  The most popular sport in NA, American Football, is played on Monday, Thursday and Sunday for a reason.  Saturday is terrible viewing time, people have better things to do on a Saturday."
"On that principle, we should never try and improve anything :("
Yeah but there is travel time to get everywhere.  And if you want to talk to your family before the games then its hard.  And what if you want to watch the horrible Pre-Game coverage!
"i dont think riot are that stupid, riot has the exact numbers, they think na has more views for a reason lol"
"""night"" at 6pm? That's a time quite a few Europeans can't even watch it because they're still at work."
"they are fine with have series parallel in the same region, but having EU and NA games parallel is kinda a no-go for whatever reason"
Me and everyone I know only tune in for games we want to see. Purely due to the pissing about they do inbetween everygame. Now that shit will give you viewer fatigue. We only watch Fnatic and TSM games
"He's not the only one in this situation though. Everyone in Europe is almost the same time-zone thus everyone working ""late"" (not even tbh, it's quite normal to end at 19-20 and being home a bit later) are penalized. "
"USA also has a heavy consume culture. Sponsors and partnerships on NA may be higher to Riot. Also weekends are good for NA because it's the dead slot of TV, so no big shows to share the audience with."
"It's a miracle!

I assume OP simply hopped on the bandwagon of Bo2s after reading a few posts about it on the front page. And given that it seems to gain traction on the sub, it's reasonable to assume that he automatically thought that the entire of EU unanimously agreed based on the relatively minuscule representation on this sub.

Reminds me of the Labour MPs in England lol.

"
"4/5/6pm it is not only 1 time zone in EU, overall EU lcs time slot is garbage, and thats well known fact."
Well you can't assume that my friend I watched all eu and na games this week I found this first week very important to find out which teams will be good to watch and which trash tier
"> Yeah, I don't know why people are saying weekends are objectively better for viewers. 

Because they are idiotic children?"
"Great, that's YOU. You can't take your situation and imply that's what most of the views are (which they are). If you honestly believe the majority number of views are people that are out of school or in college/university, then you're just fooling yourself. Oh yeah, and people usually start university around 19, right? You're an adult, even considered one by your laws, so try and use some logic, and just because your situation does not fit to what I said, does not mean the majority does not. "
"I live in AZ. I'm happy we won but who in the fuck thought not letting GB get a shot in OT was a good format for OT in playoffs? I mean, it really hurts my head that GB didn't get an attempt to TD after the fact. I don't even like football all that much and this is something that makes me want to yell at people. What a stupid rule."
I was worried when I saw that he was taken back for X-rays after the game. I guess it is just a check up type thing they are doing rather then something being wrong. 
"I never said the majority has the same issues as I have, (quite a few do, if I am to believe alot of reactions on this thread)I said a large part of europe falls under the timezone CET+0. And yes I am 19 and accountable for my actions according the law, but in my country you are truly considered to be an adult when your 21. Don't know why the fuck I am argueing with someone who just asumes to know everything about european habits and cultures when you don't even live here. You're just disagreeing for the sake of disagreeing"
"It really really depends by work culture. I'm quite sure in Germany or UK is quite strict to not do it, but in Spain, France or Italy it can be occasionally allowed when there is really no work to do."
"Fair enough. Different people with different situations. However, what I'm trying to point out that pulling out a single piece of data pulled out of context is not an end-all to arguments. There's a lot of other factors that influence both EU and NA LCS. Also, I think we have to consider the fact the Riot is trying to maximize TOTAL viewership here and that's why this schedule works well. The fact that each region had about 600k viewers simply attests to this point."
Another trash post to downvote. You failed ahziri with your hate post
"Good thing I'm not a streamer. I die 10+ times in a game every 30 games or so. I'd just be setting myself up for a ban.

Everyone fails. "
"Why does shit like this make it onto the front page of the sub? 

Fucking report it to Riot instead of posting this witch hunting garbage here. "
"dude actually whats the point of this thread...what exactly changes to your life if he got banned from league? Do u know how many people feed intentionally in league? its like you never seen a feeder. If the Rainman was just a nobody afk streamer, you'd obviously wouldn't even bother to make this thread. And you say ""Also, he decides to throw Voyboy under the bus?"". Not sure if you ever heard someone make a point before but cases like ferguson vs. plessy, people go back to in order to prove a statement. Don't even say he's throwing Voyboy under the bus when your literally throwing Rainman under the fucking hate train that only you
hate-crazed people want to talk about."
Just watch the game if thats not intentional feeding i dont know what is. Trying his best lol ryze scripter xd the guy tries to fight 3 levels behind then says ill get him next time when he has mejas then ill flash away when he's dead anyway and wastes flash he tilted and fed lol and the game after as olaf he did the same. I'd understand from a bronze player trying to fight 3 levels behind constantly but he's supposed to be plat and was higher before the guy is a troll. I got 25 mr now i can kill him now if i dodge q's sarcastic troll just ban him. I admit i flame but its people like this that give up so easily that piss me off. i just died ryze ill get him next time dies again ill get him next time etc... and just feeds him like fuck just dont fight him and play safe till help comes and he knows this because he's not as shit as he looks 
"It's still very interesting to me that when TRM feeds and is a toxic shit, it's reprehensible. But when Tyler1 does it, it's hilarious and he should be pardoned by Twitch and Riot.   
       
Fuck this sub."
he did do a lot of dmg on his team.  his team looked pretty bad. and Ryze is indeed broken af.
">Wasn't he suppose to be banned?


He was, but he claimed that he will reform so they let him off the hook. Seems like he deleted that vod also."
It's pretty clear this Ahziri has some personal vendetta against TRM. Just permaban the fker from Reddit.
"The Rain Man should just change his name to The Sad Little Man. He caught a break by being good at a game that was on the verge of blowing up but he never bothered to put in the extra time or effort or took his status seriously at a point when it was make or break. So instead of giving it his all, he figured ""well, I must just be great at this game, looking at my stats and considering I'm on a pro team"". Instead of giving it his all, he assumed greatness would find him simply because he was an early adapter. 

So season 1 comes and goes and instead of finally attempting to play at a competitive level, he now has the bright idea that people will watch his stream because of his amazing personality (lol) and instead of trying to compete at a professional level, he can simply spam Teemo in every one of his games because ""that's what the people want"" (spoiler alert: it wasn't. It was simply what he wanted). Which would have been fine and dandy so long as he wasn't trying to make a career out of it.

His decline over the years has been so sad to watch and it's even sadder that he doesn't get why he's steadily losing relevance and has become the butt of many a joke and even a cautionary tale to potential LoL pros. ""Be careful because you have the talent to make the LCS but you could also be the next Rain Man"". It's sad.

I even remember a year or two ago he was seriously trying to hype putting together his own LCS team when he was platinum for 75% of that season and low diamod the rest. Dude, Rain Man, if you're reading this... enough is enough man. Time to move on. The whole pro LoL thing didn't work out and it's NEVER going to. I mean, you don't even have a cult following to fall back on. The only people who watch you or even still know who you are either A) feel sorry for you or B) are watching you to learn what NOT to do if they're serious about attempting to becoming a pro. Hell, you couldn't even make a legit streaming career with the advantage of having an LCS background (albeit a VERY limited one), being one of the first LoL full time streamers, and having a built-in audience just based off of your name and the fact that you've been known in the community since season 1 alone.

Look at it from this perspective: Look at the numbers people like Trick2G, Gosu and even Tyler1 (before his ban) are/were pulling in. And these are people who have never played a legit LCS game in their lives. But with hard work and dedication, they built careers out of their passion. You seem to feel like you're owed a career just because you were an early adapter and it's just not true and I'm pretty sure your numbers speak for themselves.

Sorry for the wall of text but it not only pisses me off but it boggles my mind when people like Rain Man have been handed potential careers playing video games on a silver platter, only to throw it all away due to sheer laziness and sense of entitlement."
And he continues hemorrhaging viewers for being a twat.
This is clearly mobbing and harassing. If rants about League of Legends are not allowed on reddit then rants about players should not be allowed aswell. And tbh I rather read 10.000 hashinshin posts that have atleast content to discuss instead of this shit.
"3 weeks ago he was reformed as fuck being super nice on his team congratulating them on every good play and encouraging his team after a bad fight. 

Yeah a lot of his reformed attitude was sarcastic and over the top but Wtf happened?"
"The Rain Main: ""Ryze dmg: 30k. 'I thought they nerfed Ryze'"". Ryze is broken guys. "
"Reddit front page in one hour

The Rain Main banned from League AGAIN"
"His aim was not to become who he became with this level of fame, his soul is possesed by this devil and his name is... Rain Man."
Hahah washed up shitterino. He should do that garbage bag challenge again and have the bag sealed over his head instead of his body. 
"If tyler1 is perma banned, and this guy isn't, it's very obvious that tyler1 was only banned because of his interactions with big time faces in the league community (Phreak, Meteos... etc)"
He isn't black like Tyler1 so they won't ban him unfortantely 
My username is rainman and my first thought was that I'm so bad people think I'm faking it lol
"rainman deserves to be banned, I have played with him multiple times and he's toxic as fuck"
"He isn't intentionally feeding. He's feeding, but its not intentional feeding.

This guy is often a piece of shit, but this wasnt one of those times. "
"all i heard from trm response video was scripter ryze, cancer, scapegoat voyboy, cancer reddit, op is bronze, deleted vod to prove a point, more cancer, feeder voyboy, asking viewers if they should get banned, talks more shit about op"
"tbh its not really intent feeding its i dont give a shit hur dur ill just run at them shit happens losing his elo should be all he is ""punished"" with he isnt promoting being toxic/intenting like tyler1 or anything hur dur run it down mid. sucks for the people in his game but by his reactions ect... riot shouldnt really ban him or anything at this point. "
"This guy has some insanely cancerous mindset. I closed the video where he explains he wasn't doing that intentional, after he first says he tried to win the lane with 1v1 fights, and make it look like its a good thing, and then shits on lee sin that tried to 1v1 ryze and puts him under the wall as a bad thing to do. Get your shit together, before you try to explain smth cuz you lose yourself in your words."
"Honestly, rather than sarcastic, he just seems like hes upset over having a bad game so he feels rather sad/tilted imo. his voice sounds tilted off the face of the earth. He's playing badly, and it seems fairly on purpose, but it could be classified as a ""bad game"" since he seems pretty upset or something. "
OP mad cause rainman fucked his mom or something. Pretty sure OP couldn't beat a scripter/challenger booster. If Rainman had said cancer 20 less times I would actually have some sympathy for him. 
This guy is such a scumbag. Honestly he seems absolutely delusional if he actually believes he has any reason to whine about this stuff...
"this guy is straight up the opitome of low diamond league of legends players, honestly worse than Tyler1. being low diamond back a few months ago, getting into game with this guy several times is straight up torture. 

There was an incident where my friend was streaming, we got on a team with rainman, he fed his arse off building tank teemo (nothing new) came onto stream then just kept being super passive aggressive asking how we couldnt carry.

This guy's behavior is honestly worse than tyler1's, at least he can carry or do something most of the time. id rather have a flamer that i can mute, than a guy whos really passive-aggressive, doesnt say anything ""toxic"" and just builds wrong and pretends hes doing nothing wrong. >_>"
Stop being a fucking snitch holy shit these threads are here every fucking day now
Any fucker who feeds in purpose to get views deserves perma ban
[MFW Rainman is on the enemy team](http://i.imgur.com/kZlyN61.gif)
"just report it as witchhunting, posts like these are cancer to the thread, theres no reason why he had to make a post about therainman having a bad game, especially to someone who seems to be a scripter/smurfer"
"I don't even know why he still plays League. How can it be fun to constantly troll and lose? At that point, why not find another game or hobby? It's just sad. He's holding onto his history as a League player for no reason. Move on."
i heard he trolls a lot like going full ap zed and shit for no reason.
"He does deserve the attention because hes making money out of using riot´s product in way it was not meant to be. Riot has a very big interest in their community not becoming as stupid as this guy Why the hell would you leave him unbanned? Regarding the reddit threads, well it helps making the process quicker"
Maybe it's because he keeps intentionally feeding on stream and this is probably the 5th account he does it and considering the other 4 are already perma banned the comunity will continue doing so untill he get's the tyler1 treatment and get's banned on sight at which point he will stop streaming league.
"We're just tryna get him banned. We banned him before, we'll ban him again."
"I don't follow up with RM but damn, he tore OP up. So much so, that OP deleted his reddit account."
"Yeah same. I used to follow both his League and his music channel. I loved his energy, but this was like 4-5 years ago. Sad to see him devolve into the prime definition of a washup and a flamer. I hope he quits this game - because right now the game seems like a timewaster for a dude who has so much passion to give."
"but if you look at his op.gg, he does this shit every 3 days or so. http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=iiiiiiiiliiiiili "
"This. Shit happens. One or two kills when it was close can snowball a lane. Then they deny farm, they roam whIle you try to catch up in farm. Bad games happen to every person. If they're indeed walking up and getting themselves killed, that's one thing. I played vs a Morgana mid last night and Elise camped me. I was perma stunned. I get flack because of it. Which I should have more wards out probably but this is me not even parallel with the river and I get killed as azir. Shit happens and people don't understand that."
"I mean, the twitch vod was deleted, but going 0/12 doesn't equal intentionally feeding. I think people get all hyped up about drama and assume the worst, especially since he has intentionally fed before, but I don't think anyone should automatically jump to a conclusion unless they can provide a video mirror showing proof.

edit: seems the ryze is a scripter and rainman wasn't INTENTIONALLY feeding, just feeding - people shouldn't jump to conclusions (I don't like rainman any more than you, but lying about him makes you just as bad as him)"
"You do know this is actually the best way for people to get riot to act. You think a small report to riot is as relevant as making this get more attention on reddit? Besides the term witch hunt shouldn't even be applied here considering it implies the person is put in a tough spot when they are most likely innocent. He violated game rules, he received attention on reddit. Now it would be great if this happened to everybody that does the same thing because riot would act faster but that's a hard task. "
"thank you for having common sense. fucking subreddit has become a karma whoring activity. ""hey let's accuse a streamer of feeding to get more attention on an internet forum"". Jesus fucking christ if peopel would try hard at the game as the trash talk everyone on this subreddit would be challenger.
"
The only people who  think Tyler1 is hilarious and should be pardoned are the idiots and trolls that think it's ok.  
"He got a permaban for int. feeding and afking, but he challenged it and got reduced to like 3 weeks or something, so no I don't think so"
"????? If you even watched his response you would have heard that he said he doesn't think Voy should get banned. 
"
"> builds wrong

On hit tank-mo is the only way to play [Teemo in higher elos.](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/25166026#matches) There's a few ones that simply work the map better than TRM he was never very good. He's experienced but he has no potential for greatness."
"well tyler1 would do all that stuff you can mute AND walk it down mid, so idk maybe you just wish you had his mechanics and wanna let him slide, but he is still a humongous POS who is at least equally bad in terms of behavior."
"After seeing that vod it's so sad, when you don't have the skills to stay a good player you have to grief feed on a stream to get attentions.. "
"It's a job.  As long as people keep watching and he still makes money, he'll keep streaming LoL.  He doesn't hate it badly enough that it'd be worse than working at a McJob."
"Believe it or not, but some people have to have some ventil to get anger out. some go jogging, some do whatever and some have to do shit like that in games. It is not mature, but it does not make him a bad person either. In the end it is just a game and we see in this thread he also plays normal. He just does not give a shit anymore, so he trolls if he is annoyed to get something out of it and plays to win when he feels like that, Either way he enjoys himself and it does not seem to be impossible to play with him.

Maybe he overdoes it and deserves to be banned? who knows, people should just not overreact about a game..."
"Why does Reddit have to be the police. Let the players in the game use the report system and let things get dealt with by riots hand, not by pitchforks and silvers. "
"Two wrongs don't make a right, just because Voyboy fed doesn't absolve him of feeding. It's a good thing this post was made to expose TRM for feeding. He's not justifying his own feeding, just trying to redirect Riot's attention away from him so they don't ban him like Tyler1. It's just sad."
"Yea he did. He was trying to finish the chess game before the game started and thought he was close enough to turret to not get fucked. He was mostly interested in getting the money for charity and apologized for the game after. It was 1 incident and Voyboy has no history of Int feeding. (Also where he died isn't where he was. He was under turret but Ahri charmed him further into lane but TRM doesn't ever rewind far enough to show his original stopping point behind turret. Just wanted to point that out.)

It's foolish for TRM to try and compare one of the most positive League streamer's single instances against his own extremely negative attitude and repetitive cases of Int feeding."
"No, witchhunting is accusations based on hearsay and attempting to have action taken against a person or persons without regard to the evidence presented.

aka ""Shoot first ask questions later""

"
"And most people take this into consideration, and would be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt...if it wasn't a constantly recurring issue that he has even been banned for in the past. He tries to defend himself with the same bullshit excuses every time it looks like he might finally get punished for it because he gets scared he might actually get perma'd finally."
"Eh, it's not that I hate him or anything, rather I'd rather allow proof to not disappear. I don't really know him so I choose neutrality. "
When he started making bank I don't think he did it once on stream. He realized the potential he had in a solid income as a streamer. It was too late though Riot simply didn't want him representing the game with his past.
"I think Tyler1 is a good player.

I think he should not be pardoned until well into the future to give time for him to reflect his actions, after appropriate probation perhaps a pardon can be given.

I also think he ruined many people's games, but I enjoy watching him just as I enjoy Qtpie. That doesn't make me a troll or idiot."
"idk TRM feeding is more annoying to me than Tyler1. At least Tyler tries to entertain his fans while he does it. TRM just whines like a little bitch and says stupid bitchy shit.  

Tyler1 just seems like a guy that either cares too much, cares too little, or is appeasing his fanbase. I can't really come to a conclusion. Whatev tho, everytime I have an opinion about Tyler I get downvoted in this sub. "
You can challenge bans? Damn I always thought they were final.
"ah my bad, I only got halfway through the video. i misjudged then."
he was actually challenger lvl but his accounts never survived long enough for him to get there
You're changing this game and bringing it to a scary place with that gif.
"he is definitively a good player, i've met lot of scripter in EUW and usually the majority of them have a really terrible farm with shit gamesens but their mechanics is insane that's how you spot a scripter


His farm is also high, and with your screen it definitively look like he have some brain, he doesn't fit the scripter norm


Probably elo booster"
"dodges, very robotic movement, shit cs, shit builds (every ryze scripter I see builds shit like frozen heart + banshees)"
"Typical bandwagon reddit comment right here.

Tyler1 actually had really good gameplay."
"Tyler had good gameplay actually insanely good gameplay,And he also started being less and less toxic(In game)outside of his games he still was toxic but he didn't write it or runned down mid."
I think comparing TRM to Tyler1 is actually an insult to Tyler1. TRM has always been the personification of a whiny annoying little bitch.
Except hes been doing it for years... you can look up old clips on youtube of him raging and trolling. Hes been seriously trolly since he left TSM (actually even when he was with them he was). It not because of Tyler1.
"Tyler1 is no longer a problem in a League sense. There's no rule against him ""coaching"" or being a stream personality in other games as long as he's not verbally abusing teammates and feeding. 

I think he may still play off-stream anonymously, but there's not a whole lot they can do about that. I guess just look for the Master tier Draven main with hundreds of reports."
he won't make more money if riot does its job and ban him.
Do you really think people will watch a washed up mediocre player with attitude problems just because he was mentioned on reddit? 
Reddit isnt banning anyone. Riot is.  Whether they got their case from reddit or their own system is irrelevant to me.
"he made sense, i didnt get to see the game but the way that Ryze seems to play like a pro or scripter.


people just like to throw shit to ppl they dont like, i mean if i dont like dyrus i wont shit around everytime he streams just to see when he made a mistake so i can make it public right?


charity or not, one of the most positive guys out there or not he plays high elo ( dont know if this game was high elo ) and taking adventage of someone semi afk is more than enough to pretty much ruin the game.


people want TRM out? just stop talking about him and he will be gone.


bottom line, scripter, booster, xwx, whatever TRM got stomped by someone better and thats it."
"Ehh Ive clicked the video away after a couple minutes. All he said were falacies. Whether people should talk about Voyboy doesnt matter when were talking about TRM.

I actually dont care about either, i used to watch Voy a lot but i barely watch him now.

Circlejerk is a thing, ignore it or make actual statements instead of falacies."
Because it was 1 afk and he wasnt even trying to die?
"Because it's an exception. Voyboy went AFK for a couple of seconds and didn't think it was bad. He always shows exemplary attitude on his stream. It wasn't great sure - but no intent and not a regularity.

TRM on the other hand isn't exactly a first offender. He's been toxic enough to receive punishments - that's saying something. Was he intentionally feeding? I don't know. He deleted the VOD. Doesn't speak for him."
"I can't tell if you're being serious or not. Woosh on me if you're joking.  
Either way, if you've spent some times watching voyboys, you can tell the guy actually tries. He knows he's good, and he knows he can rely on his talents to outduel people from behind. It doesn't always work, but he will try it. Voyboy is genuinely trying to win the game. Besides, if you look at the timer (2 minutes in), voyboy died right at the start of the game trying to end his chess game and move on to league (end of a blitz chess game). There was a lot more on the line to end the chess game than to be 'Right on time' for league start.   
If you watch the vod http://www.twitchvods.com/watch/v74283543 from 2 hours 30 minutes. I mean, it might be a strategy similar to proxy singed, but I highly doubt. TRM played teemo a lot. Like a shit tons. He knows his output. He knows how much he can take. He knew on almost every deaths he was going to die.  
You can see he has taken his decision to simply push no matter what and almost never back after dying twice to kindred gank and lee giving out a kill to ryze in 1v1.  
You can see him take horrible decisions, like obvious below gold decisions. If this was in bronze, from a legit bronze player, it would just be ""he's horrible at the game"", But this guy is a former pro player.  "
I don't think you understood my post. I was agreeing with the guy saying that bad games happen. I wasn't talking about how if this is a recurring issue then he shouldn't get banned for it. 
"nothing wrong with off meta picks when youre as skilled as QTPIE, hell even Bjergsen goes Azir ADC when he's forced on ADC and he does decently, or Azir TOP and he does decently"
"Oh, well in that case he isn't making money.  Nice to hear I'm wrong."
Tyler1 has been like this since he started playing league so. You can still find videos from like S3 when he is super toxic
"I mean, not saying that he sucks as a player or anything, but it shouldn't be surprising if his popularity incentivized would-be streamers to be more toxic."
"TRM has always been a toxic little shit. At first he got away with it because he was still respected under the TSM brand. After awhile, his viewership declined to nothing (because of his shit attitude combined with not being a top-notch player) so the toxicity went less noticed. Reddit just recently shed the light back on him."
people say he stopped being toxic but he really didn't. he just did it a bit less. there's a reason he's permabanned.
He stopped being toxic because he got brought into the Dean's office of his school. Lol.
"> And he also started being less and less toxic(~~In game~~ on stream)

He wouldn't have got the big ban across twitch/all riot accounts if he were less toxic in game. After all Riot's about that reform, even if you've been extremely toxic.

"
This sub wanted to crucify Tyler and now that another toxic person comes you act like Tyler did nothing wrong.
"> Tyler1 is no longer a problem in a League sense.

He has a large league community that watches him spectate other league players who attempt to emulate his play style.  He encourages them to feed if someone KS them and whatnot.  Riot banned him for toxicity and people made threads because of it, in the end they made him a huge success and increased his reach exponentially in the League community all while being basically out of the hands for Riot to stop now."
"> I think he may still play off-stream anonymously, but there's not a whole lot they can do about that. I guess just look for the Master tier Draven main with hundreds of reports.

Of course he does lmfao he even said it as soon as he was pbed"
"They can't get rid of him forever without an IP ban, which isn't even that effective since it could cause problems with people who share an IP with him. Don't blame Riot for assholes being assholes. "
Reddit is a bad way of doing it imo. I'm sure 99% of the people who wrote these comments have never played with him and probably have never watched more than a YouTube clip of him. Not an accurate way to gauge things.
popular streamers are also held to a higher standard. nobody is going to make a reddit thread for a random that's gonna get him banned
"I think the problem is even if he isn't explicitly trolling, I have frequently seen him go top or mid and die early a couple times and then continue to fight the opponent like hes not behind. A couple times going something like 0/10 or worse because hew just doesn't care and will kill himself over and over on an enemy he can never beat at that point."
His support games are borderline trolling when he just roams and feeds kills all over the map. Shit he does that almost every time he plays bard. I'm not saying it's intentional but to say he's playing to the best of his ability is quite a stretch.
if the people who trolled on my team decided to pick something unconventional then do the most damage and have a decent score while doing well i would be a lot happier then getting told to die of my cancer or afking
"Yeah but compare it to before Tyler got banned, Tyler let up and I'm pretty sure if you took only his last month of League game play (Before his perma) it would not warrant a perma ban as 90% of his toxicity was done on stream and not in game."
"I believe rainman started going downhill when he was kicked off (or left) tsm which was before s2 iirc. He's not ""copying"" tyler1..he's just being his ol toxic self. "
"That's true,I'm just saying that feeding in plat while being terrible at the game wont get you fame like it did with Tyler."
"None of the Coach Tyler replays feature people actually feeding. He essentially casts banal platitudes into the aether, only contributing a very defined personality and memes. "
"> Riot banned him for toxicity and people made threads because of it, in the end they made him a huge success and increased his reach exponentially in the League community

His viewer count dropped a lot after he stopped playing. his spectate games hover around 4-5 top spot. Not nearly close to pre-ban views which were getting him #1. "
"People were making countless threads even before he was banned. He would still be streaming to 10 viewers if it wasn't for Reddit upvoting him to the top of the front page every day for over a month, whether it was positive or negative coverage."

https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4jxeaw/a_different_perspective_of_the_other_players_in_a/

Is a good description of his typical behavior in champ select

He's a fun guy to play with in dynamic or to watch, and won't really rage at you, but he definitely fucks around in a lot of games, will put his team at a disadvantage for the sake of entertainment, and has a very ""my way or the highway"" approach. If another streamer tried pulling the stuff they did they would get a lot of flak, and anyone who played like him in high elo would get a bad reputation fast. He gets away with a lot due to his popularity though."

Nb3 is known to be salty flammer on stream. That's not good enough to prove that qtpie has pissed off other streamers.
"The guy in the second link just complains that QT plays what he wants. QT went Fizz support and they wound up winning, him with the highest damage on the team. Playing what you want to play in the role you have isn't trolling if you aren't intentionally screwing the game up and are trying your best to win.

Forcing others into your own perception of what a role should be is the disruptive behavior, if anything. Supports don't need to rush sightstone every game. Supports don't need to always be a fucking tank. Supports can be whatever they want as long as they are doing their best in lane and communicate with the team about their intentions. If the team doesn't want to play around that and do their own thing, that's their own fault, is it not?

"hey I played this game since early season 1 and never been chat restricted or punished, am I doing something wrong??"
"Uh, being nice isn't required, that's right. 

But if you read the summoner's code, you can't be toxic. To say a decision is ""completely unacceptable"" when you're being punished for being an asshole is the most entitled, whiny thing I've read all day. "
And I am just sitting here thinking why it is so hard for people to NOT get punished ... It is NOT a requirement to be toxic in this game right?
It is really odd that so many users on this forum comes out and defends toxic players nowadays.
"""Behavior is irrelevant""

If you believe this, then I feel sorry for you.

People need to understand that there are consequences for their behavior. It is NEVER okay to be toxic and I'm glad Riot is finally putting their foot down on toxicity.

If you want to be toxic, then this community isn't for you and you shouldn't be playing League of Legends."
"Actually you're supposed to follow the Summoner's Code, or whatever the version of that is with no summoners, while playing league.  So you're wrong, you ARE required to not be toxic :)"
"All the people saying that any swearing gets you reported or you cant banter are totally wrong, I swear all the fucking time, I bicker with people, I get frustrated when people throw but you know what I've never been punished, hell even in the endless tilt I've been on recently I still manage not to get reported while swearing and yelling about every fucking thing.

Let me explain clearly so read closely, the other champions in the game are played by REAL PEOPLE, that means you should treat them like real people! Real people sometimes argue, real people sometimes shout, but you know what, I've never reported someone for arguing, I report people for being Pieces of shit! The people who intentionally say things or do things to piss you off, or people who pretend that there teammates are robots and just fuck off and do whatever they want while laughing at the frustration they cause.

Did your Diana just dive 1v4 and throw? ""What the fuck godamn it diana dont go in 1v4 okay defend until dianas back up, dragons in 2:10, dont split anymore guys""

Ashe keeps dieing bot lane? ""Ashe man, srsly your fucking 0-4 I know they keep diving you but I don't have tp for another 2 minutes, just let them take the tower and do anything not to die we can still win as long as they don't snowball anymore""

Sometimes all it takes is typing ""awkward"" in team chat when someone dies to prevent them from tilting, be fucking human you assholes!

Your dealing with people, some of them are kids but you should treat them like adults, the toxic pieces of shits are the ones who really don't give a fuck about others, they say stupid shit like ""I play for fun who cares about winning"" then proceed to 1v4 typing lol in all chat as they throw the lead, the people who chew and chew on someone for a mistake that they CANT UNDO, like its going to save them lp if the person begs for forgiveness for making a mistake. Jesus

Chat restriction literaly means that your not mature enough to type NOTHING! You are compelled to be a rude asshole! A game we are all playing for fun and you think you deserve REWARDS while causing people to feel like shit or hate playing the game? Fuck off!

Alright I just want to add while I dont think first time offenders should have everything permanently taken away I think repeat offenders who are probably more than the 1 % should get booty blasted.
"*Whaaaatttt?* Riot not giving away shiny boarders and swag skins for people who are assholes during game play? *Noooooooooo...*. How dare they try to promote a pleasant environment no matter who lolKorenaPlaysSweetRank you are..

"
I love how all the toxic assholes that ruin the fun for everyone are now crying.
"Chat restriction and other lower tier punishments, sure, I agree with you.

But if you get a 14 day ban that's pretty much the same level of toxicity that gets you banned from LCS, so I don't see why you should deserve end of season rewards."
Don't think I could care less about toxic players crying on reddit. The solution is easy for you. If you want future rewards stop being toxic and if you don't get it the fault is your own entirely.
maybe you should stop being so fucking toxic in game. its not that fucking hard.
"> Completely unacceptable decision.

Disagree. I accept it fine. Try just not being toxic."
"[The Summoner's Code](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/) exists for a reason. It is not an optional thing. Play the game while following it, or don't play. Not receiving rewards is lenient compared to being banned."
"Got chat restriced for 25 games and banned from ranked for 7 days because I had a bad day and went on this corki who lost me my promo because from 20th to 60th minute he died 1v5 and we just slowly started losing. Like, I get that I shouldn't have flamed him, everyone has bad games but people like him really iritate me.

That was my only ""ban"" since season 1, oh well, no rewards I guess :\^)"
"Sorry, but you don't get to decide how the Border, Skin and Icon are rewarded. Riot does. Maybe work on not being toxic?"
"I would rather have a toxic person on my team than an afk. Atleast the toxic players actually try to win, while there is AFK, Trolls, and people who INT feed and riot doesn't do anything about it. People aren't going to stop trolling, or being toxic now because they're not gonna recieve awards, so good job riot, again. Also, for people who chat restricted thats so stupid, not only have they already paid the price by playing all those chat restriction games, I myself have been caht restricted for because of me retaliating to people who INT feed on purpose. Like people have said, remember that one bad you had? Riot remembers."
"Don't want your rewards taken away, don't be toxic... that simple."
"""Being nice isn't a requirement when playing League of Legends""
It is, summoner code. If you play the game, you agree not to be a jerk towards others. Plus it's just simple education and politeness. Be toxic if you want, but I'm okay there are more and more severe punishments, it's the only way people stop doing that : the fear of the punishments."
"Toxic players will not give a shit if they get chat restricted or didn't get a mystery skin, they *will* give a shit about not getting season rewards. As harsh as it is, it is justified. Toxicity is a huge problem and giving people motivation to not be toxic is great."
how do you curb toxicity? making it so all your friends know you didnt get a border because youre a toxic piece of shit is a good deterrent. 
No mercy or sympathy for the radioactive slime in this game.

"People acting like Riot owes them anything. I guarantee over half of what is said on this subreddit would never be said man to man.

I've had my share of bad days playing the game and have yet to get restricted. I have a feeling any kind of restriction requires taking it way too far. "
"If you can't accept it then don't play the game.  In society, if you break the rules, you get punished. And this is further punishment.  Considering you have to try pretty hard to get banned, or chat restricted, not getting banners and reward skins is a just punishment.  let the salt flow on reddit!"
"I have over 5k normal games, over 4k ARAM games and probably around 2k ranked games. I've never been chat banned or warned, or banned from the client. The truth of the matter is you act like petulant, self entitled children. You call people names and you shit talk people when they have a bad game or make mistakes. So as much as you don't want to hear it you don't deserve rewards, learn to play the game to have fun and to improve your skill."
"Completely unacceptable? That's laughable.

If you did something worthy of being banned/suspended/chat restricted or whatever, you deserve to lose out on the fun, free stuff.

You don't need a reason to not be an asshole."
"Honestly, I'm glad toxic people won't get any rewards. Nobody cares about the mistery skin, but the border, that's a real punishment."
"How about you never be toxic? Solves the problem right quick!

It's funny to me that once the governing body of the game, who is entitled to make the rules, is in the wrong according to a bunch of people being punished by those rules.

That's like the police taking advice from thieves on what the punishment for theft should be."

"No. Those are rewards that Riot doesn't have to give you if you are an asshole. Not giving you something isn't a punishment, it's just not giving you something. If someone doesn't give you a Birthday present, is that a punishment in your eyes?
"
"Everyone complained about the toxicity in game, everyone made threads asking Riot to do something about it. Riot finally takes actions against those toxic players and everyone now complains that they shouldn't be so harsh. Does this mean that a lot of redditors are toxic and that they only wanted to hate on Riot before? 

I personally agree with this change. This will make toxic players rethink their behaviour much more than some chat restrictions. "
"I've been playing for 3 years now. I play maybe 2 games a day, maybe more on the weekends of if my friends are on. Never been chat restricted, banned, or even reported. 

It is clear that if you are a toxic player, Riot wants you to immediately reform completely, or stop playing the game. Toxic players are the worst part of the game, and their removal should be on Riot's highest priority if they want to function as a business. 

How many new players stop playing the game cause they get flamed while leveling up? How many people have a bad experience in a ranked game and straight up quit ranked or even the game itself because of a toxic player? Each time this happens, this is one more player who will never buy a champion, skin, or chroma. Every time toxicity occurs, there's a risk of revenue loss.

Why should Riot be lenient about that? They scramble and spend a huge amount of time to fix problems that affect maybe 3 percent of the player base, like bug fixes. Toxicity is a problem that affects 100 percent of the player base.

So yeah, toxic players do what they do best. Whine and bitch when they don't get what they want. Maybe they'll leave the game. Riot will be perfectly happy with that. I will be happy too, typin my ""lol"",""XD"", and ""fiora flash 12"".

"Nobody said being a decent human being was required for living life. Do you get punished when you fuck up because of it? In short, yes. Is our job not a status of how well we lived our life? If you're toxic at your job you will most likely lose it. Riot has given warnings for over a year if you're still toxic you deserve nothing from this game just like you've given the 4 other people on your team nothing. "
"Toxic ppl needs to be punished...
Stop crying ffs and try to apply for rewards next year"
Translation:   I'm better than the majority of people that aren't toxic.  It is unfair that these unskilled players get a reward and I get punished.  I should be rewarded and looked at like a god for being better than these beta losers.
"First of all, being nice, and not being toxic are two way different things. Riot has the honor initiative (lol) for people who are being nice. But not being toxic IS a requirement of playing league of legends according to the ToS and Summoner's Code we all agreed to. As a player that has been playing since season 1 and never got a chat restriction or ban, I am glad they are finally dishing out some meaningful punishment to their outrageously toxic community. "
"It's not unreasonable to exclude toxic players from other rewards.   Their behavior warranted significant repercussions already, so it's unreasonable for them to expect a reward of any sort because they're a shitty person.  

Only the vocal minority of toxic players are crying about the announcement.  "
"if you are toxic you do not deserve ANY rewards. why reward someone for consistently cursing out teammates and just being a jerk. maybe this will stop people from acting like a tough guy behind a keyboard, maybe it wont. I'm all for it."
"I got accidentally auto-banned then unbanned early once I proved i wasn't profusely toxic and they gave me a 10-win IP boost to compensate, am I still screwed? :( I worked my ass off to get my scrubby bum to gold, I'm seriously so saddened."
"I am totally on Riot side. 

In 2012 on my 2nd year of playing I was extremely toxic ( I know it) and I got banned for 2 days. Then I changed and never get banned or restricted again. 

While I understand skill is important, it's just so difficult and unpleasant to play with people like 2012 me."
">Being nice isn't a requirement when playing League of Legends, just something that is appreciated and Riot rewards you for doing so. Obviously you get punished for being toxic, but that is exactly what chat restrictions/bans are for. There doesn't need to be any further punishment.

This argument relies on the idea that there is supposed to be some middle ground between the ""niceness"" that we want rewarded and the ""toxicity"" that we want to punish. Riot's message with recent reform methods and behavioral goals is clear: there's no middle ground. If you aren't good enough to receive rewards, then you've been bad enough to be punished. You're in one camp or the other and being nice *is* going to be a requirement going forward.

I agree with you that there should be a middle ground of behavior between being generally good and being generally bad. Assumably the people in this area are both punished on occasion but should also receive some/all of the general rewards. But Riot sees things differently, and this forced dichotomy between ""good players"" and ""bad players"" is their decision."
"it's honestly shocking how sensitive/emotional this community has gotten over the years. it's pretty scary that riot wants this game to be some childhood playground with no swearing/badmouthing/trash talking. i've played many other games and no other developer is this concerned with ""toxicity.""



i started playing in season 2 and there was always friendly banter/trash talk, nowadays you get reported for literally ANYTHING that little 13 year old jimmy finds offensive. tell someone to play safe after they get solokilled 2-3 times and continue to overextend without vision? reported for being ""toxic""  

it's comical at this point."
"There are too many idiots saying things such as ""ITT: toxic people regretting themselves lololol""

It's not about that at all. Not even close. I've never gotten any chat restrictions or anything either, no I don't think it's hard to stay unrestricted, whoopdee doo. Similarly, I have never shoplifted. I don't think it's difficult not to shoplift, either.

If the US government comes out and says ""shoplifting is now a federal offense"" and proceeds to sentence every 2015 shoplifter retroactively to three years in prison, the fact that I have never shoplifted doesn't make that reasonable whatsoever. What even is the logic behind something like that?

It has nothing whatsoever to do with how ""easy"" the punishment is to avoid. It has to do with punishing excessively for minor offenses AND changing the punishment halfway through the year, then applying it to people who did so beforehand.

Now it's not like some MLB ""Mark McGwire did andro before it wasn't allowed"" thing, it's not like toxicity and chat restrictions are something where people can say ""what, those are bad?"" or act like they were only assholes because they didn't know it was wrong to do so. No, you always know toxicity is bad, and there's no excuse for it, but put simply, some people just can't shut up. They're never going to change. Hence the presence of chat restrictions. But you can't suddenly stack an additional penalty on top of the restrictions, especially one so excessive.

Anyway that's just my two cents, sorry for the text wall"
"People really defend players that act like assholes towards others now?
All I can say is that I´m a pretty disputatious (I don´t know if this is the best english word in this case) person, means I will tell people that blame others while playing like shit themselves that they are the reason we are doing bad and that they should stop blamming others when they aren´t any better.
But I can say that I never actually flammed a person that didn´t deserve it, even if they deserve it i don´t use any mean words actually.

I never got any kind of restriction, which means 99% of the people that actually get one of theese restrictions are propably the people that bully their teammates for nothing."
"OP and others aren't defending toxicity. They are trying to say toxicity and rewards based on SKILL, not BEHAVIOR, should have little to nothing to do with each other. People talking about how those against the punishment are guaranteed to be toxic themselves are dipshits who can't read OP's post."
"Never been chat banned or anything, playing since late season 1. There are a lot of reasons why Riot is dumb.

1) A lot of the systems they use are automated - there's plenty of possibility for someone who got falsely reported or punished to now miss his rewards even though he's deserving. 

2) Lyte and Riot have a raging desire to cure toxicity. It's why it took so long for us to even get a low priority que to weed out some of the trolls and shitters. Reform has always been their goal, and this decision completely is ass-backwards from this viewpoint. The fact you get punished even if you cleaned up your act is a massive fuck you.

3) you announce shit like this at the beginning of the season, not the end. Now people who have been punished can possibly say ""fuck it I'm not getting reward anyway"" and go back to being assholes. 

4) Borders and the victorious skin are huge motivations for a lot of people climbing the ladder - invalidating them and the hard work people have put in is going to discourage and drive away a lot of people.

I agree with punishing Elo boosters, people who cheat the game and system, and consistently toxic people. But punishing anyone who has ever gotten restricted or banned? It's not so black and white and a lot of people are rightfully pissed off in my mind. 

Edit: I'm going to be that asshole here and say people are really too fuckin sensitive nowadays. The fact people get scared to even say anything is really sad to see."
"Why riot waste time witch improivng chat restrictions, u can mute flamers/blamers. But they dont care about trolls/afks in ranked..... Wake up please rito pls"
Sticks and stones will break my bones but words will make me cry and cry and I need someone to come hold me. please send help.
"I just feel like Lyte's taken this ""war on toxicity"" a little too far. Half the time people complain about a feature that should be in the game that every other competitive game has, Riot responds with ""but muh toxicity"". That should speak volumes. Voice Chat? Muh toxicity. Sandbox? Muh toxicity. I wouldnt be surprised that they tell themselves replays arent going to be implemented because then it would cause people to be more toxic or some shit."
"I mean it's pretty easy to not get banned/chat restricted. Those of you that were actually toxic enough to get a chat restriction or a ban shouldn't be complaining, it's honestly hard to get them."
"First of all, you couldn't be more pretentious in your title, even if you tried. How is this all that needs to be said, when it is only your biased opinion?

Second,
>Completely unacceptable decision. 

O not. I find this decision completely acceptable. 

My only fear are those who were reported for no reason and due to the automatic system they received a warning. I myself received a warning for just saying ""Good luck and enjoy the game"" and nothing else, but that was it, a warning. No chat restriction, no ban, nothing. My girlfriend received also a warning for speaking Spanish with me in the game, but nothing else. You have to receive more than a couple of reports from trustworthy people to receive anymore than a warning. However, it could happen in some cases, albeit obviously not as many as people posting in Reddit about how they have been banned ""for no reason, just because the fucktards of my team are losers"". So that is my only concern, people who are falsely reported and punished.

If that is not the case, I think you should not receive the rewards. Rewards, as playing League of Legends in general, come with the agreement that you are not going to be toxic and you are going to follow the summoner's code, which you accept when you create your account and patch after patch. We could discuss about taking the rewards away only from people punished in the last half of the season because some other people may have changed their behavior, etc. However, for me, if you have been toxic, you do not deserve the rewards. It is not like Riot should bribe you to behave. You should behave or not be allowed to play. And then, if you behave and you are skilled enough, you receive the end season rewards, which I probably won't because I am terrible at this game.

"If there's something I absolutely hate about how this subreddit, it's the extreme black and white mentality of how it treats toxicity.

If you say anything, ANYTHING in opposition of Lyte's proposal to deny ""toxic"" players end of season rewards, suddenly you're an EU flamer who's butthurt that they're not getting rewards and your argument is invalidated by Ad Hominen bullshit. Let's not forget that person below you who never got chat restricted after not talking much in-game for so many years, and this thus somehow validates Lyte's system.

Personally, I care as little about end of seasons rewards as I care about what the analyst desk thinks after an hour of listening to them in-between games. But the amount of people on this sub who act superior just because they're polite is sickening.

This game is a social game but it's not a politically correct family friendly romp, most people spend all day having to carefully consider everything they say at work/home/etc. and shouldn't have to politely and carefully ask the 0/12 Vayne to stop trying to 1v5. they should be allowed to risk the punishment of a chat restriction for telling that Vayne exactly what they think of their next-level mechanics, not risk losing all end-season rewards, going into low priority queue and get banned for two week in a game they may have invested a considerable amount of money into."
"I'm not sure why you think this is all that needs to be said, or that your opinion is so solid that it ends all discussion.


I think the biggest thing you need to take a look at is your opinion that ""being nice isn't a requirement when playing League of Legends.""  It's actually Riot that decides if that is true or not, and they are sending a very clear and consistent message lately that being nice IS a requirement when playing League of Legends.


This isn't targeted at you in particular, but there seems to be this feeling among a small percentage of the user base that they have the absolute right to play this game, and Riot has the obligation to provide them access, regardless of their behavior.  That is not the case however, and Riot is saying that yes, there are plenty of online environments where you have the ability to act in whatever way you please, but League of Legends is not one of them anymore and if you can't adjust to that you might just have to move on.  And that is absolutely within their rights.  They have no obligation to provide players with a platform for bad behavior.  But I don't think any of my silly words on the matter are going to change anyone's minds."
"Well, according to Lyte climbing the laddr *should* be done in a sportsmanlike fasion. That is why they don;t want to give the Season Rewards to toxic players. It's just a matter of opinion and priorities. Well, Riot's opinion here takes the first place here."
"The whole idea of toxic is fucking stupid.  Its an online video game and it even has a mute button built in.  Seriously.
"
"nowhere in the faq for ranked games is meantioned that you have a right to get end-of-season-rewards. the thing, you people ""worked"" for is their position on the ladder. noone is getting stripped off of this (undless your account is permabanned, but then you wouldnt get any rewards anyway). 

many seem to forget that riot doesn't have to give out a free skin and borders at the end of the season. sure. it's nice and since they did it all the previous seasons, it's kind of expected, but just because something has been done a certain way for a ""long"" time doesn't mean it can't be changed eventually.

i'm not saying, that i completely agree with lytes statement. i think, it would ahve been a better choice to say somethign like that at the beginning of the season. but i think, these are some things, people need to keep in mind.

">  Completely unacceptable decision.  
  
From a toxic player's perspective"
"So I have been working my ass to make it to Plat this year. I have never left a game intentionally or fed intentionally in my entire 2 years of playing League of Legends. I have accumulated every single skin in the game because 1: I love the skins and they are fun to use and collect. And 2: Because I want to support Riot for the work they do day after day in order to make League of Legends what it is. So I went to school for the majority of this year. And at my school they blocked all gaming internet connections from literally anything video gaming related. So I couldn't play league unless I used a VPN, which I did. Now occasionally I would lag out and try to reconnect and etc etc. half way through the year this happened so much to me that I would sit in games waiting to reconnect because my computer would take so long to restart that I would miss so much of the game and affect my team mates. I didn't want this to happen, and after awhile I came back to playing normal's. And I would have the same reoccurring problem of D.C'ing, after 3-5 games of this I was banned for 7 days by the AUTO BAN system. So I emailed support in frustration and asked to have my account back sooner. And this is what they said:
BowlO'Ramen (Riot Games Player Support) Nov 05 14:13
I understand how these suspensions can seem harsh, but this system was put in place for the greater good of the community. I'm sure if you had a player on your team who left the game or sat at base, whether intentionally or not, you would hope that player received some kind of warning for their behavior.
As I said before, we understand that accidents can sometimes happen, which is why we first issue warnings and short suspensions. These measures are intended to allow players to resolve the issues causing them to disconnect.
While I understand that there's a large difference in intent between leaving a game voluntarily and disconnecting for reasons beyond your control, I'm afraid that we really aren't able to make that distinction. If we were to differentiate between disconnects and voluntary leaves, it'd open up an opportunity for severe abuse - where players just sever their connections manually rather than face the penalty of leaving a game. As such, I'm afraid that any situation in which your account does not participate in the entirety of a game can be considered a ""leave"", whether that be your decision or otherwise.
Now as much as this made me angry, I accepted it. And thus I stopped playing League until I made sure that I could fix my connection issues. And I did. So I learned from what the support staff said to me. I didn't want to affect my teams and so I fixed my issue and continued climbing the ranks. Here I am 7 months later finally getting my Plat V 23 LP and I stumble on RIOT LYTES IDEA OF HOW TO DEAL WITH PLAYER WHO HAVE HAD THESE RESTRICTIONS ""ONCE"" THIS YEAR? Are you kidding me. After all the time, money and effort I put into this game. Thinking I was helping Riot and bettering my self as a player who simply wanted to fix his internet connection? I am in pure disbelief. I feel completely shunned. So now I don't get my Plat banner or ranked rewards? I have no words to describe how I feel. It it just mind blowing. This cannot go through. It is simply wrong, unfair and absurd. I should have no reason to not get my Ranked rewards at the end of the season."
"They're wrong with this decision on so many levels. As you said, the rewards are being given for the skill and only the extreme cases should be punished. I got banned for 14 days, was given 35 ranked restricted and 75 chat restricted after I got unbanned for a game where someone really got on my nerves after he suddenly called me a retard when I died on botlane. He didn't even get banned from what I checked a few days after my instant ban (few mins after the game). The system is just about being LUCKY, not TOXIC."
SSW World Championship taken away because Imp called some a stupid shitter
I understand being punished for an offence. But then suddenly they throw in a throwback punishment for your week of toxicity during the first weeks of ranked perhaps? Punishment for being punished. All in the name of competitive integrity. GG rito.
"""So guys, what if we took the people who already behaved badly. then told them that they're rewards for ranked are getting taken away, that way they can go on a rampaging trollfest and ruin everyone else's experience because they are being denied what they want""
Seems legit, no way this could backfire. Take the toxic people and remove their incentive to play cooperatively, genius."
I completely agree with this but their system is still broken. I was toxic last season with chat and ranked restriction but still got a mystery skin that I didn't deserve.
"Can we get a context link, something to the main article or whatever this is about for the people that don't know?"
"I can agree with punishing toxic players, but what about players who have been chat restricted at the very start of the season and then reformed? From what I remember the system is there to reform toxic players not make it worse, and coming from someone who's been chat restricted for defending my own plays and using curse words, not verbally harassing and name calling, this just seems unfair. 


I'm at a point where I don't even chat. The chat window's scaling slider is set to the lowest it can possibly go and I make sure not to type or read it unless I have a good plan for the game. I can't tell someone to try buying armor in top lane because I will put them on tilt for suggesting it, I can't ask the jungler for ganks because of the same reasons.. I'm done trying to chat with other players and since haven't had an issue with being reported or banned.. I've seriously sunk a ton of money and time into this game, and I really enjoyed it, but at this point it's going places I never thought it would. Bias and personal feelings aside I think this isn't the best way of dealing with this. Repeat offenders/bans should get this treatment, not players with a one-time chat restriction or even short suspension. Remember: the keyword is reform. For players like myself who are way passed being reformed and into being scared to communicate territory, it would be nice to be rewarded for that. . . The way they might be handling this is just so depressing. "
"On one side I can see them trying really hard to find an alternative to curbing toxicity, and I can really sympathize with that. But with the current systems and how easy it is to get reported/chat restricted over the most minor things, I wouldn't want to deal with this kind of extreme."
"Just how do they keep making those f'ed up decisions and statements? I really do not get it. The backlash those statements (rewards, sandbox to name the most recent) generate is so devastating and immense. "
"But not being toxic is part of the summoner code, I understand that punishing one time offenders for chat restriction or low priority queue is not favorable, and I don't agree with it.

But multiple offenders + players who have been banned for serious reasons (account sharing/boosting/buying RAF bots/scripters) and players who had their ranked restricted at some point clearly go against ToS and/or summoner's code, so I'm fine with them being punished.

Rank is a display of skill (well, elo is), rewards aren't.

I guess this would also, as a side effect, decrease elo-boosting quite a while, since people did it for the rewards, but now if you know you're not gonna get them anyways, there's no point in paying for something that disappears at the end of the season whether you get caught or not"
Or maybe you shouldn't get chat restricted? or rank banned?I think it's a fair solution.If its what it takes for you to be a better person ( or stop playing the game for all i care) then thats what they gotta do.
"***We judge others by their actions and ourselves by our intentions*** or something like that. 



You're probably a bigger asshole than you think you are, because you did do something for quite a bit of time to have been punished. "
Toxic players are acting like butthurt babies right now. Sad that your asshole behaviour finally has consequences now? 
"season rewards are not a reward for being nice, thats true. but not getting them for being an asshole is a punishment that is well deserved. chat restriction or anything else doesnt really hurt toxic people. but the reaction we see here means that toxic people will actually suffer from their own toxicity. its finally an actual punishment that really hurts some people."
"Tbh there was smth wrong with the Mystery Skin reward too. I got a ~60 chat restriction and even a ~30 games ranked restriction once and I got my good behaviour mystery meanwhile I was chat restricted.

And I'm not alone. I'm certain that a few other ppl on my friendlist who at least got chat restricted once before (or meanwhile the skins were being distributed) got them aswell.

And what's gonna happen to the people who got banned accidentally? When something new for this punishment system was released (I think on EUW and EUNE first) I and many other people got a 2 weeks suspension for 1.5 days and what we got for that short, but still unfair ban? An email that they apologize that the new system isn't flawless yet and banned out many innocent players and the account is no longer banned.

Sincerely, someone who had some real bad days in the past, and they were noticeable in my games, but still being positive in predominant amount of matches."
"Good point, toxic players should get their rewards too, but not mystery skins. "
I totally agree.  If I get diamond and get one chat restriction because people report me because they are upset that we lost.  I don't see that as fair.  Got my upvote rito please..
"Are you serious ? wtf is wrong with this subreddit. All year long there are 12301239012 posts about toxic players ruining the game, how it's so hard for people to play the game because the community can't behave properly, how riot doesn't do enough for toxicity (has anyone you've reported ever actually been banned ? rito pls); the first time Riot actually puts forward something that will seriously motivate players to not be toxic in ranked, ""omg riot how can you be so insensitive, unacceptable decision"". Steps like this actually actively encourage people to NOT be toxic in ranked, which I don't know about NA, but is a HUGE problem in SEA. The only thing that people care about from Riot in terms of awards are the Border, Skin and Icons. Imo, this is one of the best ways to combat toxicity. You can't have the cake and eat it too, if you really want toxicity to be removed from the server, support this decision, finally Riot is actually doing something decent."
if you be a dick expect to be punished simple enough lol
"To some extent I am irked about this change, as my sole chat restriction on my main account has been from when I have been playing with my irl friends, and they have reported me as a joke multiple games in a row which resulted in a chat restriction. Although I generally am not bothered by receiving the awards on my main acc, I still think the line of punishment is a tad harsh or well at least lacked transparency. At least my smurfs will still receive the diamond border though 

PS: I have had ribbons multiple times for long periods of time"
"I swear half the people on here supporting this change don't understand what it means to have already been punished. What do you think a chat restriction is? Just a warning? ""Hey, you've been bad. Keep being bad and we'll really punish you"". No. It is a punishment in itself, there is absolutely no need to pile on another punishment, especially to people that were restricted at the start of the season and then have changed their ways. This is like serving 20 years and then being told a month later ""oh get in back in jail, you're doing another 10 because fuck you""."
Eventually Lyte is going to make it so that you don't gain LP if you get chat restricted. Gotta curb the toxicity down some more.
"I won't lie and say I'm not toxic, my main hasn't been banned for toxicity though. But why does Lyte keep trying to force his stupid/unnecessary social experiment on us. A competitive game will be toxic by nature especially since it brings out the worst in people in certain situations. Anybody who has done anything competitive knows that."
I got restricted once about 10 months ago for the first time since I started in early January 2012. After that rest. I really feel that I have behaved a lot better since I just decided to stop talking all togheter in chat unless it's something about what we should do next. Doesn't matter though since when the tribunal gets working again I'll prolly be permabanned since I was a piece of shit racist kid like 2 years ago.
"no rewards no risk, fellas embrace your inner BM and toxicicty."
"Says the obviously toxic player now buttmad, nice shitpost dude"
I feel chat restriction isn't enough to warrant a lose of season rewards......bans are but not chat restriction.  
Theres a difference to being toxic & making then learning from your mistakes
"Im calling it right now, once the toxic players lash out and take their anger out in your ranked games then this will no longer be a good idea. There should be a different type of punishment like a 4 week ban because this current idea will just give incentive to toxic players to just be toxic as they have nothing to lose anymore. "
"I like it. It's not like it's easy to get a chat restrict, you have to be pretty toxic. I've been racist, sexist, rude, told people to kill themselves and all that shit and have never gotten chat restricted."
"Basically Lyte makes borders show how nice each player is... If you have borders then you are nice, else you are toxic. "
[My reaction to all salty toxic players that won't get rewards](http://i.imgur.com/grgWwQI.gif)
"> Last year, toxic players didn't receive a mystery skin. That is completely fair. 

I did. Rofl."
"good call op. Another thing i detest is that why is it for all of s5? I was ranked restricted at the VERY START of the season. Completed them, not a single chat restriction or ranked restriction since. I did my punishment, I reformed, why am I going to be punished again?"
"I think people are defending ""toxic players"" because wasn't there a time where chat restrictions were literally handed out in metric fuck tons for people that barely said a word?

Yeah me being one of those. I had a game where I literally said 4things all game and I got smashed with a 14 fucking day ban and a 50 game chat restriction. I said 4 words. "
"Time to report everyone in my game so they don't get their skins because ""I'm not going down alone."""
"I completly agree with OP. I got chat restricted 2 times now on my account and i wouldn't say I'm toxic. I'm more like passive aggresiv. i wirte things like: 'Hey Lee Sin maybe u shoudnt play this champ when cant even Insec.' (I'm in Dia5). I never threaten somebody / wish them cancer. That beeing said, I always report people for 'Offensive Language', even if thats not the case, because this report feels the most rewarding and I think most people do so as well. But in my opinion this is a classic fail announcement by rito and will not go threw anyways..."
"For the record, I didn't receive a mystery skin, and I have absolutely no record of bans or chat restriction, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one."
"The thing is, some of these things aren't even about behaviour. 
 
I've received a 20 minute low priority queue a couple of months ago because of connectivity issues that made me crash during the loading screen for about 50% of my games and wouldn't let me back in. But the problem only started when they updated to a new patch, and stopped when the next patch came out.    

So for an entire patch, I kept DCing from games randomly, not because I have a bad attitude and didn't want to play but because my client was messed up and I couldn't fix it no matter what I tried.    

And now I'm not getting rewards this season. Thanks Rito."
"I think they should put some limitations, like if u have been chat restricted for more than half the season( or half your games), if u end the season with restriction. I know i am biased, i was restricted in the frist 3 months, why screw all the rest of the season, especily when they introduced the new system it was handing restrictions left and right"
"i can live with my chat bans, and rank restrictiones. they are all deserved.

but i want my season rewards.

i think it might even be contraproductive... solo q will be hell the next few months, cause now they really dont got a reason anymore to behave"
"You're the kind of guy who plays Kalista and let his support die when he makes a mistake even if you still have ult.

Just, you know, to prove your point and make the team lose."
"It feels as though Lyte has a lot of power now,  and needs to get sacked off for abusing the power,  the season is like coming to an end soon and he announces this  it's kinda bullshit as to if this was announced in the beginning of the season, which would give players a chance to understand the risks of flaming and ect. "
"I got chat restricted and ranked restricted for leaving a game wtf?!?!?
I didn't even flame..
 "
"I've received low priority queue's after I've had a bug splat or a firewall error, which really pisses me off, the 20 minutes you HAVE to wait is punishment enough, now you're going to tell me that after 4 years of playing and finally hitting gold (yes I'm terrible at the game) I'm not gonna get the season rewards because of your clients crap? gg wp"
"Some are notorious trolls, snipe people only to troll their games, others afk everytime someone take their blue, and yet the punishement is the same to those who had like 15 chat restricted games. Yeah, Riot's logic strikes again."
"So what about the players who have gotten one chat restriction, changed their attitude and are more friendly now? youre just saying fuck you, mess up once its over. This makes 0 sense, at least make it for repeat offenders."
"Okay everyone shut the fuck up for a minute. The problem with riot on this issue is not that they are taking away the solo q rewards it's that they are taking the solo q rewards close to the end of the season without the prior knowledge they would do such a thing. Riot please don't do this for season 5, make everyone aware that Riot will do this for season 6. If you're toxic and get suspended and are overall just unpleasant to play with have at it take away their free shit you give to them. This is like telling your son you will get a present for your birthday but a week before your birthday your dad tells you that you won't get anything because you push Johnny off the swingset 5 months ago. "
"The people defending riot make me sick, you have a point, but you only have a single point and refuse to understand the blatant downsides to this new system, I see streamers who don't even talk in game get chat restricted from reports frequently, the chat restriction system was flawed as hell until recently, they're gonna have to at the very least, wait until the new season to implement this otherwise people like athene and uberdanger off the top of my head will not get rewards simply because people don't like them and reported them when the system was ass."
"I'll throw in my two cents for all the good they may do.  I could care less about the rewards or mystery skins or any of that horseshit.  When I signed up to play this game nobody promised me any of that so I don't expect it.  The real issue with ""toxicity"" and criticism of Lyte is that all this nannying that Riot is doing is for nothing.  The problem with their game is that ""toxicity"" is inherent to the structure of their game and they never make any efforts to cure the problem, only treating the symptoms.

League of Legends is a game where most people play with strangers and are held hostage for 40-60 mins by the worst members of their team, in terms of behavior and skill, whenever they sit down to play. Right from champ select the most bitchy troll on your team has the power to dictate how your experience is going to go and whether or not you are going to win or lose in most cases.  There's no way to kick a toxic player, vote him out of queue, or remake without penalty if it's clear from jump street that you are about to waste an hour of your life.

There is no VOIP to communicate with your team, meaning in most cases people who are intensely focused on their cs or winning a trade might not see your quiet little chat or listen to your ping because in the heat of the moment a lot of those sounds get lost in the background and then because it is in people's nature to deflect blame on to others, flaming and other things start to snowball games in a bad direction.  People who act like assholes might just be assholes, but I have watched many people I know in real life who are calm and level-headed lose their shit in game over how frustrating the experience of playing LoL can be.

Personally, I am a chronic leaver, and I don't plan to change my habits until there is a better system in place for getting out of a shitty game where I'm being held hostage by whoever is trolling and whatever other two deluded players who will never surrender under any circumstances.  For me, no punishment or restriction that Riot could hand down will ever be worse than being stuck in a frustrating game that turns me into a spiteful asshole, so I just leave games that have devolved into that.  I have no problem with low-priority queue or bans or whatever.  I would gladly take them any day over being forced to be miserable in a game, which is meant to be fun and recreational as opposed to a goddamn social experiment that intends to correct my behavior.  I personally have never even seen another game go to such lengths to scold and punish people, and it seems kind of silly and pathetic that they take so much pride in it, but whatever.  

TL;DR

My belief is not that this game just attracts toxic people or that there just happen to be a ton of assholes in the world who wake up wanting to ruin someone else's day, but rather the inherent systemic flaws that never get addressed in this game bring out the worst in many otherwise regularly tempered players.  Riot needs to fix their game and not their players."
"I agree with the decision partly. I think it's perhaps a bit too much on the people who've only had one or two chat restrictions, and I don't think it's fair on the 20 minute low priority queue. As far as I know no one is deliberately AFK to the extent where they'd end up in that low queue.


I really think announcing it this far in is kind of scummy. If this was an announcement for next season then fair enough people are warned and can adapt their behaviour accordingly, but there's nothing to be done in terms of reformation now and I don't like the feel of it."
"I think that while it can be harsh in some cases, this forces people to stop and think about their behaviour. Yes people get reported/LPQ/ chat restrictions for stupid things they shouldnt. So i think they need to find a way to go around that but ill be happy to see people not boosting accounts and making it harder for us lower people to climb, and hopefully people will be a little nicer in ranked now."
"Am I taking crazy pills? While I think Riot went **too far** in further punishing first time/reformed offenders, I think a significant portion of the restricted players are underestimating how much it actually takes to get a restriction/ban.

You will NOT get punished for swearing/being annoying/raging back/having a bad day/false reports. I swear all the fucking time on LoL, annoy my teammates when they fuck up, rage back at other flamers, and sometimes take it ""too far"" when I have a bad day. 

But why did I never get any restriction since I started playing? Because:

1) My cussing doesn't have malicious intent (there is a difference between ""Shit! you messed up that ult..."" and ""You are SHIT for messing up that ult..."")

2) I may hate my feeding teammates' guts, but I don't continue to pester them throughout the game since it WON'T help anyone.

3) People *usually* won't bother to continue flaming me for being bad if I'm not being a dick in the first place.

4) I do take it ""too far"" when I have a bad day, but this is extremely RARE, and even if I deserved the report, I wouldn't get punished for just one or two outbursts; it would have to be a common occurrence for me to receive a punishment.

5) FALSE REPORTS DON'T DO SHIT. If you've been restricted/banned, then 99.9% of the time you deserved the reports. Just check out /r/LyteSmites if you want to see proof"
"im toxic to already toxic ppl, ppl who flame teammates for no reason, so i make them angry for their angriness. Got one time chatbanned cuz of this, and now i get no season rewards, i love rito for being so facking stupid in some ways, i dont find the logic"
"Hey, here's an idea!

Stop being a toxic fuck and ruining the game experience for those unfortunate players that are stuck playing with you and perhaps you might not have your FREE rewards for playing a FREE game ""taken"" from you!"
The best thing is that there are still the undeserved banns from earlier this season...... where just how many reports you got counted because there was nobody who looks on the in game chat infos (and I have a feeling that that is still the case because there is no tribunal etc.)
"Master Player here who got Chat restricted several times - still, I support Riot in this decision."
"Do you believe what you say? ""Being nice isn't a requirement when playing League of Legends, just something that is appreciated and Riot"" That is false and people believing in such things are some of the reasons toxicity is such a huge problem. You are playing in a game made by riot in an environment given to you by riot. Their servers, their rules. Summoners Code. You have to accept you are going to follow that code. You even have ti click accept twice, like you need to if you accept the legal terms when you sign up for some website or web service. So why exactly would it be an unacceptable decision to take away the end of season rewards from those people? Why would you give anything to people who ruin the game experience for so many people. One toxic person is enough to make 30-60 minutes of LOL a horrible experience - and if you do these kind of things so often you even get punished for that, you should not only get nothing but lose even more bonuses like beeing excluded from all ""earnable"" summoner or bonus skins etc. But no, riot is giving you a chance. We know there will be rewards as a bonus for beeing good/neutral all season long. You get a chance to show you have changed and you will again get these rewards. Taking away something that was till now a reward everybody got is just the right step to tzake this even further and maybe get some more people to rethink their attitude. sad that something like this is needed, but still, the right way to go. "
"Lets say, you are just an ordinary student (who has average scores in exams, but who if trying hard enough can even achieve best results or sometimes meserably fail and get worst grade) and you have a group project, but you get into a group with 4 bullies, who has never touched you and you even haven't had even a talk with them. Group project starts, you start planning, researching etc and you suddenly see that those 4 are doing nothing, even worse, they are swearing at you, make fun of you even sometimes punch you for not doing your job and earning them a good grade. All that happens while teacher went to library or principles room. Then you decide: okay, i wont do anything too, maybe i will stand up to them and try to punish them somehow or even say something salty to shut them up (just this once) and BAM, teacher comes in, sees your bad behavior and hears the insult coming out of your mouth, sends you to principle, you get detention, bad grade and a notice to parents  after what follows punishment from them too. You are like: okay, i can accept that, next time i will be more careful and won't do something like that. Time goes by, school year comes to an end and you see an announcement with big black letters: **Those who recieved punishent of any kind won't earn any rewards for good grades. According to our rules, they also will need to caary with them a sign which say that the student is with bad behavior and ahouln't be trusted etc at all times.**
So what's the point of even trying to get those good grades and be good fot the rest of the year it you get 200% or even more punishment l, when the system isn't even close to being 100% perfect?
Same goes in League of legends, Riots punishment/report system isn't even close to being 100% perfect, and yet they want to punish players fot twice the ammount those players who only stood up to bullies or had a few bad days. Even for those players who flame, but have achieved their place ir their current rank don't deserve this, not even talking about those who won't recieve ranked rewards because of errors in the system. What errors? Lets see, you don't need to swear, flmame or do any of those things, you even don't need to type anything in chat, all that requires are some players who hate you. Yes, you can easy get chat ban/ranked restrict even by being nicest person in the world or never typing anything in the chat (atleast you could in spring and before that). How? It is simple, you can have a bad day and play badly or even not that bad, but there are players who wants to punish you for that and they report you for offensive language, because they know how to abuse report system. If that isn't enough, they even can convince other team players to do the same and you can't prove you are not guilty. After few games like thet you get a warning which is followed by ban, nice, isn't it? And what if you get the same players in more than one game? Sadly jerks like that exist and nothing can be done about that, you just have to sit quetly and get punished again and again and on top of that not recieve ranked rewards. How do i know that? One of my friends got ban just like that, he is a nice person and never flame, even in lost games try to raise morale of his team. So we tested it, created new accounts and wrote in /all chat, that specific player from our team is a flamer and needs to be reported, we were all 5 premades and he got atleast 6 reports per game, after 1 game he had a warning and after 3 more games a chat ban. He never wrote anything in chat, not even timers. We tried to contact Riot support, but got tired of automated responses. I don't know if this works now, but sadly it was like that and noone cared. 
Sorry for my bad english. I hope atleast someone wasn't too lazy to read my opinion on topic.
 Have a nice day!"
"If this decision make it through I quit. Like WTF I worked so hard to become dia and then all the work is like nothing just because I flamed??
"
Rewards are supposed to be for players who climbed to gold. We're they toxic? Doesn't matter. They should get the skin anyway. And don't get ne even started on low priority q.
people who got ragereported by 4 premades are the real losers... this lyte guy doesnt seem to be very intelligent
"I think they'll fuck up with this  I can bet even toxic players will earn ranked rewards, like they did with the mystery skins"
"Quick question, does the EU now get the information on why we've been banned? 

Just got 75 games chat restriction and 35 ranked restriction. I'm sure its probably deserved but I can't think of anything particularly bad!"
"Right, as a flamer myself. i ofcourse got hugely sad when i saw the lyte post. but ofcourse we deserve a punishment. i mean not this hard of a punishment . but **A punishment.**
before someone starts to call me names or anything. let me just tell u. i **WISHED** i wasnt a flamer. like seriously its so hard its stupid. i just get mad sometimes when i see people making the worst mistakes. or not  playing seriously thus making me lose games unnessecery games. i dont even know how to stop flaming. ugh fml.
oh and please keep in mind.. when i flame, im not one of those kids who tells u to get cancer or cusses ur family. i normally call u a twat or something along those lines. >.>"
Last I checked every player agreed to follow a code of rules that dictates their behavior. And even then rito is pretty forgiving so long as you're not afking all the time or spewing hate speech. [I've seen some of the things a friend or two have said without getting punished. ]
"I disagree. If you can't play this game without having the need to make other people feel bad, then go play single player games. If you I agree to the summoners code, you agree to be respectful to both allies and enemies, both in victory and defeat. If you can't do that, league is not a game for you.

No, having a bad day is not a good reason to call people shit. You see them play in that one game. Chances are if they are the same elo as you they are just as good as you. 

And no, having a 10 game loss streak is not a reason to say your teammates deserve cancer."
"All these ""Angels"" who never been chat restricted coming and blaming all ""toxic"" players. We shouldn't forget there are people (not me) who are really into league and playing fulltime to become dia,master,challenger ; simply to become the best possible. If you are tilting or someones trolling in your games (because you take the game very serious) you sometimes flame and be mad, this is normal and can happen. Chat restriction are the right way to punish this, but the players playing to have a master border at the end of the year. This is just unfair to all these players"
I strongly disagree.. the summoners code is a thing for a reason and the community is so toxic that it actually runes the game. Riot is finaly doing something about it which is nice!
"Riot is a company that thrives on selling content in a multiplayer game. Therefor, the game needs players who like to play this multiplayer game. If you are toxic, you pose a risk for the company. Toxicity is the numer one reason people quit the game.
Riot does not give free stuff to people who risk their game. Deal with it."
"Its a game guys.

I dont get why riot is forcing a behavior so much into a GAME.
im having a bad day? i mgiht tell you to go fuck yourself, so what? 

Is it just a game.  

i dont see the point of all thsi war agansit toxicity.

Instead, they should do something for the new players, most of my friends didnt even make it to level 10 because of the toxicity, THAT is a serious issue.

Not a diamond player telling another diamond player that he sucks, that is normal, and if you ask me, needed. "
"mfw.jpg i take chat restriction for calling a guy noob when he doesnt ward, and some guys keep spamming ""retard"" ""cancer"" and other shit after the game in post game chat and get NOTHING "
"It's hilarious that people are even trying to argue this. The only reason anyone would be against this is if they've been banned or restricted this year. It's not hard to not be toxic guys.
"
"I politely disagree. I also impolitely disagree,  asshole. "
"It doesn't even make sense. I've been chat restricted before I got the free mystery skin and now I don't get end of season rewards because of that chat restriction? I am so confused.

And to people saying ""don't be toxic and you'll get your rewards, better luck next season"": is your head really that far up your arse? 
I had a couple bad days at the start of season 5, I got chatrestricted, I bettered myself, didn't get chatrestricted again. Now, almost at the end of the season, I get punished for something I did MONTHS ago. 

It's like a dog took a shit on your carpet, you cleaned it up and 4 days after the fact you grab your dog by the neck and shove his face into the stain on the carpet. The dog is going to think you're being aggressive just to show dominance, not to tell him that what he did was wrong because the dog DOESN'T REMEMBER IT. It literally has no effect other than either making the dog doubt your leadership as pack leader or it's going to make the dog super docile. Then again I guess that's what Lyte was going for in the first place: to make every single player afraid of communicating on the off chance something they say might hit a string with the people they're playing with so they could get reported and possibly punished SEVERELY for it."
"Honestly, I'm fine if they do it. I've never have had any chat restrictions/bans, and I've started to play in Season 2. And I don't even consider myself that nice, I sometimes say stupid shit just like anyone does when you get too salty, everyone is human so that's understandable, but that's still only in 1 of my 50 games or so. So if you've been chat banned/etc. I honestly think you deserve it. Maybe after this season, people actually start to think how you act in game, and get the next season rewards. Maybe they shouldn't take the borders away, since I think that's too much for someone who has climbed to challenger/diamond/master etc. And maybe taking them away from 1 ban is too much. Maybe the first ban could be a warning, giving you a message in the lines of ""You've been acting like an idiot, get your shit together or next ban will take away your rewards?"""
"Started this season in low Bronze. Currently in high silver and I got reported for critisizing people who go 1v5. I rly tryharded cause I wanted the gold rewards so badly, but now? lol "
"I really don't see the issue with toxic players not getting season rewards, it takes a lot to get restricted the first time, so if you've been restricted you definitely ruined the game for multiple other people, and skill is no excuse for being an asshole.

I just don't see how it's so hard to not be a massive asshole every single game."
"I think they should give end of season rewards to everyone that passes the required goal (gold or higher). If flamers are too much of a problem for you then just use ""/mute all"" that's what I do. Not here to defend the flamers but to be honest getting through silver/gold is an achievement of its own. If you do don't get anything for getting gold or higher just because you were toxic once or twice and got some form of restriction, then you wasted your time. Because 90% of the players do it to get somekind of rewards, simply being plat 1 or gold 1 doesnt mean much to them. They need somekind of award for climbing.

TL;DR: End of season rewards should be seperate from the rewards you get during the year for being nice, climbing is a challenge of its own."
"shitty client, sandmode, low priority cuz of 10 min afk due to the crash and now this.... there is less and less reason why i should continue to play lol.... (and yes, we should chat restrict and ban players for horrible behavior, but taking away borders/victory skin which are rewards for skill is just missguided)"
"I totally agree with op on everything. During this year I had a difficult period in which also my LOL climbing wasn't good and I was really frustrated. I got chat restricted for 75 games (which were A LOT to me at that time since I played like one every 2/3 days). I got my punishment and I made it out of it. I'm almost plat now and I WANT my rewards. I got them by grinding more than 200 ranked games and that's reality. If I don't get any rewards this season I might seriously think of quitting, as also every other person in my same situation I guess. Because we grind elo for self achievemnt, and if our small reward gets taken away because some ass at riot is trying to make the world a better place, then fuk u, I'm off to Hots."
ITT: Salty toxic players who think they deserve rewards
"Reports are based on what other individuals in your game find offensive. This creates huge inconsistency as you could be in a game where there's mutually accepted 'college style' humour, or you could be in an environment with people that are expecting a more... 'dinner with the Grandparents' style of conversation.

Riot can reward whatever they want. If they want to base their season rewards off of behavior then that is fine. Some players will feel cheated that this information has only come out after they've already been restricted (assuming the information is correct of course) but again... not Riot's problem.

I think the whole automated reporting system needs scrapping as it is simply terrible. Bring back a community run tribunal, and provide rewards for accuracy. At least then there is a jury for your 'crimes' and not just some automated system that operates purely on number of reports (posibly some very basic logic that can't take into account context) and allows players to be scapegoat-reported for a loss by their team.

The system that I would use would be something like this.

- Player is reported a significant amount of times for various reasons.

- Player is informed that a tribunal case is being prepared for community evaluation. Their next 10 games will be considered in the verdict.

- Player plays their next 10 games.

- Tribunal case is presented to the community. Chat logs / reports / builds etc... A clear checklist of common behavior issues for games prior to the player notification is filled out by the participants.

- The chat logs / report details of the 10 games after the notification are presented to the tribunal.

- A set of basic final questions are asked:

-- Would you be able to enjoy a game with this player on your team? Yes / No

-- Has this player improved their behavior in their last 10 games? A lot / A little / Not at all.

-- Do you believe this player should receive a punishment and if so, what level? None, Light, Medium, Severe?

An automated system can then determine the level of punishment that the player would receive. A player who has shown improvement in their last 10 games will receive a slightly lesser punishment than they would have normally. The vast majority of players would make sure that in those 10 games they are perfectly behaved which means hey... the community gets at least 10 games of non-toxicity. That's a start right?

Repeat offenders have their previous tribunal case conclusion shown at the new one. An additional question could be asked: Has the player shown improvement since their last tribunal case?"". If the answer is no, the punishment can be even greater.

People who have had a tribunal case against them cannot participate in tribunal cases themselves.

If you provide decent rewards for completing tribunal cases, we, the community would be able to police ourselves in a fair and reasoned manner.

Because the current system is vague and undocumented, players have no idea what the lines are and when they have crossed them. Sure, maybe if you set hard lines people may push right up to the limit, but you may also find fewer people cross them. If Riot do not want to implement a community run tribunal like before, then at least allow for some sort of instant reform, or reduction in punishment.

For example, a player gets chat banned for 100 games. Maybe at the end of a game, give non-premade teammates a quick vote. (Was XXX's behavior acceptable this game?). If votes are consistently saying yes, the player will see a real time reduction in the number of games they are chat banned for. This gives them real incentives to behave better in EACH game. ""Your team mates have deemed your behavior to be acceptable in 8 of your last 10 games. Well done! Your punishment has been reduced accordingly"". While this means people can get out of their punishments quicker, it is providing players with a game-to-game incentive to behave and ultimately all the community (and Riot) want is for people to behave and enjoy their games.

Currently players are chat banned, fire out abuse to their team using their 5 messages, get chat banned for longer and just get more and more angry. They try to behave a little better but at the end of their chat ban they just receive another one and get frustrated because in their eyes, they were behaving fine.

Anyway, this is a massive rant and I'll stop here. This system needs changing and pulling rewards from people will just make them more angry, not encourage better behavior. People need opportunity for reform, not additional punishment."
"I think you're wrong. 

When you're an asshole you deserve a ban. That they give you 20 chances and just take away the free stuff for you is almost too nice, because you are still able to play. 

Riot is doing it this way because being nice IS actually a requirement, everytime you meet people. "
"Yeah. You're being a decent person. Start blaming your team regularly and spamming chat with 'report noob' and 'gg we lose team useless '.

Edit : I see the EU flamers have woken up and found out them not getting the rewards. "
"I have a good friend that is SUPER fucking toxic, like wishing cancer on people toxic. He has never been punished in any form.

I have to play solo queue with people that are legitimately awful people, they're clearly not restricted (P1-D4).

Whoever is actually restricted is logically worse than the people I see regularly, so I can't possibly believe they deserve anything resembling a reward from Riot."
"But, but, BUT I didn't know they will take my season rewards, why they are telling this now?! If they said it earlier I would be nice, I HATE LYTE!!!111

/s"
"""I'm going to switch to dota if this happens."" Oh i will be so happy if all the toxic league players migrate to dota. They may even leave the subreddit. Ofc they are all bark and no bite as usual. :( i can dream though. "
"Dude, gonna be honest. Idk how they have either. I cuss people out in a game on a daily basis and I haven't been chat restricted yet. These ppl claiming that they had a bad day I think is bull shit. I have actually personally started to tone down my toxicity tho bc I tend to win more games when I just mute everyone, but idk how these people have 1 bad day and then bam. They must say some fucked up shit in chat."
"hah, noob! Not even telling players to kill themselves!"
"I've berated my team for more things than I thought humanly possible during my first year of playing, and I've never had a temp ban. Pretty sure you have to go WAY out of line to get banned or chat restricted."
"It annoys me that people who get punished think they are entitled to AT LEAST something, no you're not entitled to anything there's a reason why.

Just like the top comment said. I myself have been playing since beta and not once have I been punished(Although I should have in Season 2) and I would have accepted my punishment."
"I don't either.Low queues are punishing enough that they don't need another. I swear it is worse than chat restriction or ban since you may not talk  or you can move to another account for some time but you HAVE to wait  20 minutes nonetheless. This happened to me so often that Im starting to lose my mind:

-Wait in low queue for 20 minutes

-Get into a game

-Someone leaves

-Find another game

-Client gives some weird error and resets queue

-Have to wait for another 20 minutes"
"Because fuck you that's why. 

Now buy our new skins! "
"Yeah that and Op being :

> Last year, toxic players didn't receive a mystery skin. That is completely fair.

Then : 

> They changed it up this year, apparently. Completely unacceptable decision.

It's not like people get punished for no reason.

Even though I think Riot stance is a bit harsh for people who got a small chat restriction and reformed since then (I expect Lyte to address that specific point very soon) you shouldn't have to make any effort to not be an asshole in your games."
"Exactly, toxic players lose more games as the statistics show. Also, you make it hard for anyone to enjoy themselves when you are toxic. LoL is about playing a game, enjoying it and, ultimately, winning it. When you are toxic, you destroy two of the three purposes of the game, so surely you should not get a skill-reward if you are toxic. Part of being skilled is also being able to create an environment that enables yourself and your team to win. Toxic players do not have that skill, regardless of what their elo / division says."
"I scream and yell a lot when I have a very bad, frustrating game. I write a lot of things in the chat, but instead of pressing enter, I erase those messages.

Nobody is telling you that you should not be frustrated or angry. You just have to be mature enough to not pay with other people your frustration."
"Exactly this. Toxic people's favorite excuse. ""But, he's trolling it's okay for me to tell him and his entire family to die!"""
Nope.  That's why they are brigading this subreddit like crazy.  They didn't know the ToU to begin with and then got punished.  They learned nothing because they still don't know the ToU and now they are whining.
"All the time I see people posting shit like ""It feels like my reports do nothing! Riot needs to be harsher on toxic players ruining my promos!!""

My my the true colors come out. "
"Seriously. I have been playing since season one and have never been banned chat restricted or anything across 4 different accounts and different servers. 

I am not saying that those with minor chat restrictions deserve to lose reward if they have been reformed and shown improvement. However I feel that since this is simply extra things given by Riot those who broke rules and had to be banned shouldnt get them. Riot is rewarding you for not only your skill but also playing their game properly according to the rules and terms they set out but that is just my opnion . "
"Probably because most of them have received chat restrictions, and the rest just wants to ride the Riot hate train."
Yeah there was a post in a thread earlier with the most votes basically saying lyte should stop trying to make people non-toxic
"It's because a good portion of the reddit community is toxic. Ironically, according to a poll a while back, it's the minority group. However, they are currently in full force since they just lost all of their rewards."
"It's really funny how many threads got upvoted that Riot needed to crack down on ""toxic players"". How many thousands of upvotes on this subreddit. Now that they realize Riot is doing just like they asked, and cracking down on toxic players, they're up in arms.

Mmm the salt, I love it!"
"I oppose this decision even though I don't care about the toxic players - I actually take some pleasure in looking at all of the rage posts about this by toxic players who clearly haven't reformed. I care about the other people that this is going to affect.

Problem 1: People who have already demonstrated that they can be detrimentally toxic now have little reason to continue trying in ranked matches, and will troll out of anger.

Problem 2: Next season, people (especially in higher rankings) will be able to tell who was punished last season by their lack of border. People will be more inclined to negatively interpret feedback that may have been meant as constructive from players that they think are toxic, which will lead to a slew of negative repercussions for everybody involved, especially if this policy continues into next season.

Problem 3: It's nice to be able to see what my teammates were ranked last season without having to use third party sites.

EDIT: What comes down to is that the previous anti-toxicity measures were good because they reformed toxic players, and that's what Riot should continue to try to do. This policy is only made for the sake of punishment, and will only disincentivize people from reforming."
"Probably just a vocal minority. For players that are unaffected by this it's really not a big deal, but the ones who are will obviously be angry and leave a comment. 

This leaves a comment section of people saying it's a bad idea, when most users of this subreddit are probably unaffected by this. "
"I don't understand why people are considering this unfair?

Under no circumstances should you be toxic in League, and the rewards aren't anything you should be expecting Riot to give to you, they're more like bonuses. It's a privilege not a right.

There's still a ridiculous amount of toxicity in League atm so I'm completely fine with things like this."
"People understand that there are consequences to their behaviour - chat restricts, game bans and game restricts. You sadly don't realize it "
"And those consequences are bans and restrictions. Punishing them even further, even after they have finished their bans and restrictions will not make those people less toxic.

How long until this season is over 1-2 months I think? All of those ""toxic"" people were now told to go fuck themselves, they won't get a reward anyway so why should they continue trying? They will troll and lose games on purpose because it doesn't matter anymore. Their rank doesn't matter, their skill doesn't matter, all that matters is how quiet you were in-game.

Rewards for your rank shouldn't be determined by how nice you are or by how much shit you can take. It should only be determined by your level of skill.

Taking away their reward for their level of skill just because they didn't behave is a ""solution"" that will quickly backfire."
"> I don't feel like you should lose your yearly rewards if you have a bad day

You fucking should if you start flaming. When I have a bad day, I REALLY want to say my team is filled with shitty dumb players,  but then I remember I have a bit of self-control and don't send anything. "
"Being nice and not being a dick are not the same! 

The only thing Riot is asking you to do is **nothing** when you get frustrated. Is that too much to ask? You don't have to be fake or huggy-kissy or whatever. You just have to not be a massive bell end. "
"I can't imagine that someone gets chat restricted/banned for one bad day (wishing someone cancer does not Fall into ""having a bad day"" imo)"
"I completely agree with this; however I think if someone is having a bad day, it isn't justified to ruin other peoples day just because you're having a bad day. If you cannot physically stop yourself from insulting other people, unbind your enter key until you can."
"Just having a bad day won't get you restrictions (e.g. Being negative one day because you fought with your gf).  A bad day should only give you a warning.  It's CONSISTENTLY negative behavior that gets you restrictions.  If you can't get your shit together over several days (or can't take the hint that you shouldn't play until you're sound of mind), then you deserve the restriction and the consequences from it.

The exception to this is extreme negative behavior (wishing someone cancer, racial slurs, etc).  These are NEVER ok.  Ever.  I don't care how bad of a day or game you had.  If you really can't help this kind of behavior, you need to reform yourself, reform your lifestyle, or seek therapy."
"This should get much more attention.
I swear too sometimes. But necer since pre season 2  i got any punishment. I realy think most of the people aren't aware of how toxic they are."
"Exactly this. I start most of my games telling my lane opponent to fuck off. 

A simple ""fuck you"" isn't enough to push someone to the point where they're going to report you. 

It's constant harassment. There can be three toxic people in a game but people will remember the worst one. And that's who gets the report. You literally have to be the biggest asshole out of 5 people. And if you get reported by the other team then you must have really done something in all chat because I don't think the majority of people will report just because someone told them to. 

Been playing since season two, never been punished for anything that I do. Tired of people making excuses for being an asshole in this game. It's not ok. Maybe next season people will learn to shut the fuck up in chat if you want those rewards."
"I still find funny the fact HOW MUCH you must do to get a punishment. I had terrible days and -wont deny- got into few flame wars during my ""career"" in this game, but never got punished (playing since 2011). Amazing how many people are still in denial phase and say ""you get punished after one incident"". Its fucking impossible. This require almost hard work and dedication to receive reports in vast majority of played games consistently.

The worst part of this is a fact that those guys don't know when to stop playing and take a break. If you are tilted go and play anything else, something that you can't lose at to get back into better mood. Do some exercises, ride a bike, ANYTHING but another game in LoL.
"
"I am often pretty passive aggressive, but never ever flame/harass. My biggest weakness is probably the guy who is 0/10 blaming everyone else, I call that asshole out every time. Tell him that it's his own damn fault he lost his lane.

Nver one single chat restriction or ban of any kind. 

I piss a lot of people off, and I know I get reported a lot, I get warnings about these a lot, but never a punishment. I have to assume at this point that it's pretty fucking hard to actually get punished. The people who say ""oh I just had one or two bad games"" ""Oh it was just a premade and they all reported me when I literally said 0 words in chat"" no, no no no, bullshit. 

**TLDR:** I'm a little bit of an asshole and get reported often and have never been punished, I have no sympathy for you if you get punished by Riot.

Edit: commenting an angry reply only convinces me that you deserve it :)"
You can't post anything like that without being downvoted to oblivion in any other thread. I've never received punishments from riot. Ive called people idiots a few times in my lol life and I have friends in diamond who flame nearly every game they lose and still don't have punishments on their record. You have to work pretty hard for these reports to actually have consequences.
"We understood the consequences and then the consequences were changed after we stopped being ""dicks"" - a reformed mildy toxic individual. "
What about the other punishment? The low priority one.. Is that fair?
I feel like this describes about everyone never being banned/restricted/anything. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48H34ukFe8g
"This. 

I said it in the other thread - I won't get the rewards either. I was chat restriced for five games months ago. 

It was totaly deserved I'm honest with that. If that means I won't get a free skin and my dia border - well shit happens. My fault. I like that they plan to be so strict with that. 

It shows the real face of some redditors. You can see all the hate they gather atm.

"I've played since 2011, never received a single restriction. Same goes for my best friend, who started playing the game with me at the same time. He climbed from Bronze to Diamond, and I've gone from Silver to Diamond. Neither of us have been punished, people act like it takes nothing to get banned..."
"I actually find it alarming that people are actively and openly fighting for the right to be toxic.  With this post OP is basically saying, ""I don't consider conscientiousness a priority and who are you to tell me otherwise?"""
most people getting punished by this aren't going to be here next year if this goes through.
"There is a middle ground between nice and toxic though.  Be neutral, mute flamers, don't type, or just type in reference to what's going on in the game to communicate.  That isn't being nice, just neutral, which still gets rewarded."
"Don't be a dick, get the reward. It's not hard to not get banned and if you can't keep your own behaviour in check then you'll get what you deserve. Or rather the people who act in an appropriate way will get what they deserve, those who don't, won't get anything."
"If you were a dick to enough people that your behavior got you banned or restricted, then fucking deal with it. Better luck next season.

Unless you were somehow banned or restricted unfairly (which is pretty hard to do due to the necessary accumulation of reports and negative feedback), suck it up. This is the price you pay for thinking your shitty attitude should be everyone else's problem."
"Just for the record Ive been playing since season two and swear multiple times a game and have never been chat banned or warned, because I'm not a dick to other people. I don't think riot has any issue with swearing."
"And if that's why you got reported, nothing will come off of it. 

Thing is, if you say ""Stop dying you retarded piece of shit"" or some other thing like that, *then* you'll get banned. 

Also, I don't care that other devs aren't concerned about toxicity. I don't care that your high-on-melancholy brain can only remember the good banter and not the really asshole comments. I don't care for your ""I have a thick skin so everybody else should have it too"" attitude. This game is played with 9 other people, and if they don't want to deal with your 'banter' then they shouldn't have to. Not to mention, unlike other games, communication is tactically important in this game and muting somebody because his mouth is doing its best impression of a sewage pipe hurts *me*. It hurts *my* chances at victory."
"No, you don't get reported for telling someone to play safe, you get reported for saying ""I fucking told you to play safe you retard."" after they make a mistake.  There's a pretty big difference."
"Hahahahahaha excessive punishments. You can still play the complete game after the original punishment (ban/chat restrict) has ended. Literally what you are arguing about is a different color on a loading screen. That is the literal, exact, opposite of excessive."
"Point 3 is the most important one I guess, suddenly he changes the thing people took for granted and worked for. This will create way more toxicity than he believes it to reduce, people who were holding their shit entire year and improved after 1st short punishment early in the season will now flip and go full toxic."
"One of the biggest complaints on this subreddit is cracking down on the ""toxic community"".

BOY WHAT A SHOCK, REDDITORS ARE TOXIC TOO. 

You all deserve it imo. Sorry but this shouldn't really be surprising to you."
"You continued to play knowing that you used a connection that was prone to dropping.

The first thing I do if I suspect something even comparably smaller like having ping spikes is to stop queueing normals/ranked until I know the problem's fixed. Otherwise I do dick around bot matches or just play something else.

You could have tried other VPN services (it sounds like your VPN service wasn't good) or avoided playing altogether.

You're ultimately responsible for your actions. You willingly queued up with an unstable connection and ruined matches for your teammates, and they adjusted the punishment to what they thought was suitable to the offense."
"Yeah, the trick is, if you fuck up, blame someone else before they do.

If you type first, the team will gank up on the guy you insulted and he'll be the scapegoat getting reported instead of you.
"
Then go to reddit and say that lyte was bullied as a child and doesn't deserve his phd because that'll totally convince people that you're not an asshole
I flame and rage probably 1/10 games for 10 min before I mute my whole team to shut myself up and I've never been banned or anything. You gotta be pretty damn cruel to be banned
"Ive played since pre-S2 and never gotten a ban or chat restriction. However, I *have* of course said some reportable stuff over the years (who hasnt, right?)."
"I'm a terrible person and I've still never been chat restricted. Ok I'm not toxic 24/7, but you know, you have those games."
"Thank you. I've been pretty damn toxic sometimes, and i've never gotten as much as a warning. If you got chat restricted, you earned that shit."
"You're being sarcastic, but this is actually a fair argument. You don't get punished for thinking like a shitty person, you get punished for being toxic."
"Seriously. ""I'm so done with League! I won't get rewards because I've been a dickhead!"" Everybody has their reasons but there's just no excuse, and they know it. Go ahead and quit and move on. Spread that toxicity somewhere else, or invest your time into something else! League of Legends is an international giant; a few bad apples leaving won't even scratch the billion dollar profits."
It's mostly gonna be people being more toxic since they got nothing to lose.
"""I know a guy with a diamond border who is in diamond 5 with a 48% win rate and average 2.0 kda. He only got there because he played 2 thousand games and has no life. Ive played with him, he is not even good. I would duo my friend with a gold border before that shitter."" - /u/SevensSea

  Nice quote from you just a day ago, seems you're part of the toxicity yourself! You're more kept up in this drama then the people it affects. "
"Only 1% of the actual player base is chat restricted, but for some reason 10% of reddit is chat restricted."
"*sniff* *sniff* It smells like entitlement. 

""I deserve free stuff!"" 

Riot can change requirements whenever they want really. I think it is great they do it at the end to really drive the point home. Those people who are like ""If I had known, I wouldn't have been so toxic!""  How about just not being Toxic?"
"> ""toxic players lose more games as the statistics show""



Yeah, that probably has to do with no one bothering to be toxic if you're winning the game, it's when you're losing that you press tab and find a scapegoat for you playing like shit"
"In all fairness, people that troll and have a direct impact on the game are as bad, if not worse, than toxic players.

Generally speaking, there is overlap here, so it doesn't really matter. I've never met a troll that wasn't toxic, but I've met toxic players that don't troll. "
Dunno why you think it has to be that egregious to get banned.
From the like 15-20 players on my friendlist that i play regularly with only one got chat restricted once. And it's exactly the toxic one. I honestly feel that the system is pretty accurate.
"I've never been banned, chat restricted or punished in any way by Riot.

This change really pisses me off though. What's the point of even having borders to represent people's skill levels if half the players aren't even going to have them?

Get in a loading screen in ranked, 3 guys have no borders on your team and you are Diamond elo. Are they smurfing, are they toxic, are they boosted?

Like, I don't get the point of taking them away, it's there for other players just as much as it's there for them."
"""A good portion of Reddit is toxic. Ironically, a good portion is not toxic."""
"""STOP THE TOXIC PLAYERS!!!!!""

""ok we take their ranked rewards""

""WTF RIOT THOSE TOXIC PLAYERS DONT GIVE A SHIT ANYMORE AND IM LOSING RANKEDS WTF"" 

Toxic players will be toxic and apparently we don't want to give them incentives to be even more toxic, so why this? "
"not getting rewards that riot doesn't even have to give out is being told to ""go fuck themselves""?

The entitlement for a free game is insane."
If they do troll then they still won't get their rewards and they'll just get banned... I see no issue
"Exactly. Yesterday I had a really rough game at the end of a rough day. One thing that irritates me the most in this game is when I lose a lane I feel like I should have won but either I screw up or someone on my team screws up and I lose because of it. Yesterday I should have absolutely stomped the Tristana/Soraka I was laning against, I had at least 4-5 opportunities to kill them early, but my Bard was either afk typing under our tower or wandering around the jungle. We ended up losing really hard and I was excessively frustrated and wanted to yell at the Bard but then I remembered ""it's just a game and I'm not a turd sandwich, yelling at him will change nothing."" Unfortunately it seems that a lot of players don't seem to have that filter."
">The only thing Riot is asking you to do is nothing when you get frustrated.

It's not even that. You can do whatever you want in your house, shout at that guy who did X or Y, but you just can't take your frustration out on the players inside the game (or outside in the lobby). You can do whatever you want to voice your frustrations as long as it doesn't affect the players in the game. A good deal of streamers voice their opinions of their teammates in various way without being punished."
"The people in this thread claiming they got chatbanned for nothing and that they are not toxic, are the same that claim they only retaliate other toxics and only played normals when the internet was DCing every 20mins.

It's kinda sad to see that they learned nothing, still think they are innocent, and also believe that a harsher punishment is not needed...."
"Yea seriously, I'm a dick in this game but I guess I just know when to stop?  I seriously don't understand how people get chat restricted in this game."
"Same. One time a guy really got to me when I'd already had a shit day and I just fucking let loose on him for the rest of the game, calling him all kinds of motherfuckers and shitcunts and asscocks, wished cancer on his entire family, and told him to make the world a better place by killing himself (just one game). I was really expecting a temp ban after that, but nothing.

So yeah, if you get banned, you *must* have been consistently acting like a real piece of shit."
"I've been playing this game for 4 years and have never been banned or chat restricted. I always tryhard to win and will call out stupid things such as retarded build paths/itemization, but i never flame nor stoop to personal attacks.

I don't understand why people are so up in arms about not getting rewards. If you got punished for something, then it's very likely you deserved it. Getting rewards for being nice is just a bonus. You're not supposed to be a dick anyways. You won't be a dick in real life to people, so then why is it suddenly ok to do it online?"
"yeah, people here on reddit like to circlejerk about how toxic players are the ones that are good at the game and what not. and "" i rather have a toxic good player than a nice scrub"", and maybe 1/20 games i get a good player that shits on everyone in the team about any mistake, but most of the times are just people with low score blaming everyone else, that 1/5 midlaner talking shit and how did this jungler get to this elo if he doesn't give blue to the mid laner. or that 0/6 vayne and how we are such a bunch of stupid fucker for not peeling her even tho we are winning and she doesn't even fucking matter. 


today i was playing top, was at the outter turret bulling the enemy nasus, enemy jungler takes drag before my team can get there, and then they fucking chase them trough their jungle, an uncalled 4v4 where the is no fucking objective to fight for, they all die and then my 0/2 mid suggest it is my fault, in fact i think i even cancelled nasus tp and killed him. 
I guess i could have tp'd in one of the nonexistent wards of the enemy jungle and ""killed everyone"", but come on i'm doing my fucking part of the job, don't blame me for losing a stupid 4v4. So that's the kind of people i start to call out on their mistakes, being passive agresive, and never ever fucking listen to their shotcalling.  

I have never ever been chat restricted. "
"Because reporting doesn't do anything *unless you're actually doing something wrong*. 

Going 0/10 doesn't get you banned even if all the other players report you (unless you're actually intentionally feeding, which Riot will catch on to)."
"Exactly. I been playing lol since vlad's release in early s1. I had never gotten punished once other than a 24 hour ban, which was only 3 hours as i got it at 11 pm and it ended at 3 am, for spamming random stuff with a friend and a few other guys in the public chat. 

I went from D3 to P4 last season and not once did I get banned during it. For my 4+ years of playing, I probably only got two warnings telling me that I was reported. There is zero excuse. If I can do it for 4+ years, then everyone can play a season with no bans or restrictions. You dont get a restriction just for a few games. You have to be reported regularly over a short period of time to even get a low game chat restriction. "
"Once you get hit by one punishment though, you're fucked if you ever get reported during it."
"This is what I have a problem with. I don't know how the system decides if you get 5/10/20 minute queues, but if you can get it from having a rough week of internet (I've only gotten five minute queues, myself) then that's bullshit."
"You're literally violating Riot's terms of use. They could suspend and delete your account if they wanted, let alone just taking away your ranked rewards. 

If you play by the rules of the game and you won't have rewards taken away from you - it's really not hard. Not everyone's going to punish you for being a dick or breaking rules in real life but they're sure as hell not going to reward you for it either."
"I went from Bronze to Gold with a friend of mine (he left the game a few months ago when he hit Platinum) and none of us got a single punishment. The only thing we've got is maybe a warning, because everyone have bad days. The problem is when you have more than one bad day in a row, but that's your problem"
you don't get banned for saying an occasional swear word...
"Can't let facts get in the way of self-righteous outrage.

I find it hilarious that people that were probably a bunch of dickholes to others in their games are complaining about the unfairness of not getting rewarded for their performance in the game.

""Like yea, I probably ruined a game or ten for 9 other people, but it's *unfair* that I'm not getting what I expected from the game."""
"And you wouldn't lose rewards. Boom, you have to be *toxic* to lose rewards. You don't have to be *nice* to get them. "
"Nail on the head. I have a thick skin as well and I still get upset quite often with the game but I never take it out in chat and thus, have never been banned. Honestly this sub (and the LoL community in general) is so full toxic people of all calibres and that's why they're whining as much as they are.  "
"I agree and the statement from OP 

> ""Being nice isn't a requirement when playing League of Legends, just something that is appreciated and Riot rewards you for doing so""

Are you shitting me? You dont run around in real life insulting people and expect nothing bad to happen... Toxic people dont deserve rewards, simple as that."
Everyone has bad games but the people that get chat restricted just so happen to have bad games every other game. But I'm sure it's not their fault.
"Neutral players who lean slightly negative are the ones that only rage when they're losing. Truly toxic players are toxic regardless of the game state, even going so far as to be toxic in champ select. It doesn't have anything to do with winning or losing."
"Except more often than not, that ""trolling"" person is actually trying their best and they are not simply good enough in comparison with the enemy.

""Oh, so you have died 3 times? You are clearly trolling therefore I am wishing your whole family to die of cancer"".
"
But toxic players tend to think anyone is trolling if their KDA is not at least 1.0
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding was that only a small percentage of the playerbase is punished and they are just the loudest in these types of situations where they are rightfully punished. It's pretty damn hard to get chat restricted from my experience with friends and others"
"I've seen this pattern occur in other places. I'm still getting season rewards, but this is a very concerning policy to me. It just stupefies me how many ""decent"" people really like laughing at other people's misfortune. This reminds me of the false vac wave ban in April. People are very hateful and automatically assume that nobody other than people suffering could actually care."
"They aren't just punishing toxic players, though,  they're punishing victims of their garbage reconnect system as well. "
"You are absolutely right. I have these games, I even start typing, but I don't send. I know it won't change anything and could make things worse. And in the end, I remember it's just a game."
"You can even be a bit of a dick, you have to a complete and utter asshole really.

Almost every time someone gets restricted ect. and they post some of the shit they are quoted for saying, or stuff in tribunal when it was up. It isn't just the passive aggressive comments that people hate like ""why"" or wow you suck. People have to literally be berating other people or personally insulting them, cursing up a storm ect. AND they have to do it many times.

This isn't just people that were being moderate assholes, they are saying stuff that would get them shot if they said it to someone in the wrong neighborhood irl. This isn't just being a dick, it's being a literally bad human being that is going out of their way to be as mean as possible."
"There was a forum post a long while back where Lyte talked about how everybody can have a bad day where you just snap, but that it's the consistency that gets you punished."
"You were lucky. Riot has stated in the past that there a few choice phrases that immediately invokes a ban and one of those phrases is ""kill yourself"". 

Maybe your teammates figured you were having a shitty day"
"You don't get low priority from 1 game though. Yes its bullshit, but overall if your getting low priority due to bad internet you gotta ask yourself before you get into games, ""Will my internet work this time?""

The only person I've seen get low priority was some guy who plays 20 mins before he has to pray..."
"This is me. As far as my experience goes if you afk just one game every few months or so it doesn't matter, but if you afk few games in short time span you will get punished. Recent storms in my country damaged my ISP connection infrastructure and in past month I got multiple random 1-15min downtimes every day, 2-3 times a day. I afk'd and got reported in few games within 2 weeks, got 5x5mins, played it out, another single afk game and 5x10, played it out, everything was fine for few days, one game afk ended up with 5x30min. It's justified to give me low priority, but have the reconnect system been working as intended and I wasn't forced to alt-f4 the game and restart it from scratch after 30s disconnect I'd avoid half of these. It's not justified to take my rewards away because over month span I've afk'd in few games (nearly all of them I did reconnect to within minutes unless they ended or my connection was flipping entirely, just team still reported me as I was gone for some part of it and they had to put the blame on someone), and I didn't afk during rest of the season. "
"**You can even be a raging douche canoe**, just not like, a *giant, flaming* raging douche canoe. Ya know, moderation and stuff. "
"Situation: You have a group assignment. One guy is really hard to work with, as in he is an asshole to everyone else in the group. He is the hardest working though. Let's assume the group gets an A on the assignment, does this guy not deserve the A even though he contributed the most to the assignment?

And saying ""No he doesn't deserve the A, he's an asshole"" makes no sense at all, before you kid yourself. "
"I'm pretty sure it never resets though. So you could have a series of leaves for a week and get a 20 minute low priority queue afterwards. But even if you don't ever leave a game for the next 2 years, the next time you do leave a game it is automatically a 20 minute queue ban."
"I had a game the other day, I was i think 6-5 and the rest of my team was doing pretty dismally, like 0-10 dismal. 

I didn't rage, I didn't bitch, I didn't trash talk. 

Right before the final push one of the enemies started harassing me because he killed me. I was stunned as to why. How can people possibly be that sore of winners to see a landslide victory, and pick on somebody who didn't say anything?"
"I'm a raging douche canoe and I've never been punished, it's not that hard to do! "
"As much as I agree, they should start it with next season tho to avoid dem trolls getting worse because they have nothing to gain or lose any more."
"Yeah, like I said, I totally expected a ban for that because I was *way* out of line and acting like a real piece of shit.

But I didn't get it, even after all that. So to actually get banned you've got to be doing that a lot. You clearly don't get banned just for one awful day (because if you did, I certainly earned it from that one game), so the people who *do* get banned have done something to *really* earn it."
"Point of view is important, in your example and on reddit. 

Ask the people that were in his group. I wonder what they would say about this. 

Also just flat out assuming that the ""asshole"" is the one and only person that worked hard for the A isn't the best example. That would mean that only ""assholes"" try their hardest to win their league games. Which also makes no sense at all."
"That is because a lot of people think that being competitive is a blank check to say or do whatever you want without consequences.


I will always remember that time when a guy in my ranked started to insult me in ALL chat, and when the enemy team told him that he was going to be reported, he answered ""I insult him to make him play better"".

That is the logic behind a lot of people here. They don't see themselves as toxic, but rather as very competitive, when in reality they are a bunch of unmannered players.


EDIT: Let's not forget the *interesting* logic behind the argument ""I am going to show how non-toxic I am by mocking and insulting the guy who is actually in charge to decide it"". It is like calling your boss a stupid retard when he notifies you that he has received complains of the clients because you are rude."
God this one has to be the worst. Completely hate people in other thread who said that. 
The trick is to be a funny raging douche canoe. Then you get honors instead of reports. And the joys of ERP with the enemy Rengar every time you play nidalee ;)
"I know people are already saying TL freeze but people have also said ROC freeze, UOL freeze and TSM freeze, It feels like freeze is the prettiest girl in town and everyone wants him to join his team, even though there have been no reports of deals being proposed to freeze outside of speculation but who knows what is happening in the background, maybe he didnt get any offers."
"Not much of a surprise given how much trouble it has been just to sustain him in the house. Never meshed with the team even though in game performance was quite good. With Dom looking at retirement and Xpecial possibly benched, I doubt a player like him would want to stick around with younger players.

Problem being is I don't know of any major team in Korea who would want him. His skill level clearly isn't what it was two years ago and I don't know if he'll ever be able to mesh with another support in the way he did with Mandu. Could see a team like Incredible Miracle or Anarchy going after him. Najin, Jin Air, Samsung, SK Telecom, and possibly KT/KOO have superior ADCs already."
"This shit isn't hard. Until you have hard confirmation (which he obviously did not), you title the article Sources: Piglet and Team Liquid have parted ways.  
  
Or, you know, don't publish it. Because when you are wrong this makes your name mud. "
"Jacob Wolf fkin idiot, really screwed up on this one. Complete bullshit article just for views. "
"Dailydot is so garbage I always read shit that get denied a few hours later on it, I mean stop writing about rumors this isn't journalism."
"Holy shit, this Jacob Wolf guy does not have a good track record. How many times has he gotten the story wrong now?"
"The Daily Dot has lost all my respect will no longer be reading anything from their writers. A completely false lie proven so with The owner of team Liquid Steve liquid112 Archanet posting 15 minutes go on reddit the truth that Piglet's contract has been renewed through November 2016. Down vote this article to shit or report to hell. This is a slap in the face to us LoL and esports fans, report this post get it off of reddit!!!!"
Misleading Information? anyone? mods are you there?
"And Jacob Wolf officially loses whatever credibility he had left. Or is Kori gonna join Liquid as their jungler? Or even better, WingsofDeath is coming out of retirement to rejoin TSM... "
"This is what happens when a shitty journalist who doesn't do any of his own investigation takes a leak and runs with it to be ""first."""
i really should of realized when it was a Jacob Wolf article that it was bullshit
"Fake.
Confirmed by Fenix. 
https://twitter.com/LiquidFenix/status/648577275739279361"
Dailydot has lost all credibility this is just sad...
"No suprise, the language barrier was too much of a problem. Fenix is better but I am not even sure he is staying. My guess is that the time of heavy importing players just because of skills and ignoring language is over."
"Well looks like TSM suddenly found a new ADC candidate.

Or I guess Piglet might just stick to his plan of building a Korean team.  Sucks that it didn't work out for him in NA but Liquid had too many problems."
"Conspiracy theory here. 

Riot leaked this information to keep people away from the shit show that is their top 20 players at worlds list!    "
"can someone make a list of all the times jacob wolf's sources have been straight up wrong in his articles

Mr wolf maybe its time you get some new sources or stop pulling information out of your ass?"
"Its funny how quick this shit is ""leaked"" and then proven wrong, the fuck is going on"
"DailyDot best reference on esports .... not. Why do people keep linking these stupid dailydot posts? 
"
How can you make a news article about something that you are not sure and is not even true?
"The article said Piglet did not help them secure a trip to worlds. Well no duh, it's hard to carry bad people. Piglet had best KDA on the team all summer and in the Summer Split had the highest KDA of every team in NALCS. Fenix in the playoffs played very poorly and did not perform well for his team. His early deaths helped snowball their carries and put TL behind. In team fights Quas messed up several times and overrall had negative impact on their team fights. Piglet did great and I feel his talents would be better suited for a team that can play with him more effectively. Especially getting him a better support player. Xpecial played crappy most of the summer. He only had really good stats in the summer split because of how well piglet did in lane. When it got to semi finals, Xpecial messed up quite a bit by dying early, failing to hook, etc. I really dislike how the article paints it as Piglet did nothing for them."
"Oh well, this team will continue to lose until they rid themself of the cancer that is IWD."
Definitely knew it was going to happen. It was only a matter of time before a source comes out. Nothing against piglet because he's a good player. But it's quite obvious he's not the best fit for TL. 
"Don't think Liquids problem is an AD carry problem. Not a pro analyst or anything, but their pick ban is lacking and they seem to go full season 3 CLG under pressure. "
"So glad to see him leave, he was so cocky and negative. "
"So...as expected.

Guess importing washed up players isn't the ideal solution...who would've thought..."
"Hey guys, guess what!

JACOB WOLF IS A FUCKING LIAR. PIGLET4EVER"
The daily dot thinks they know all. Such a trash group of ppl
Going to be so sad if Freeze doesnt end up on TSM. TL is probably only going to be Quas and Fenix returning. Just now realizing TSM might not have any NA players next split.
"I know we all love that e-sports journalism right now is full of bad boys who don't play by the rules, or whatever, but the space is in desperate need of, at very least, some editors that have actual training in journalism. 

This headline makes a claim that doesn't appear to be true, without even a hint of attribution.

For the uninitiated, a reporter's best friend in defending against libel accusations is truth. Attribution allows you a way to ensure your reporting is true, even if the story pans out differently. You report what you are told, and you attribute those statements.

E-sports rumormongering mostly relies on unnamed sources, which should honestly be used sparingly, but are the mainstay of this scene.

If you are going to rely on shady, unnamed sources, at very least attribute to them!

The difference between **""Piglet and Team Liquid part ways""** and **""Sources say Piglet and Team Liquid part ways""** is enormous.

Maybe that seems ticky-tacky, but it's literally the difference between being able to defend your headline and not being able to defend it at all.
"
"Whats worse is he won't even retract the article and only put an edit at the bottom that frames it ambiguously. 

> In a tweet, Team Liquid says Piglet re-signed with the team on Sept. 21, extending his contract through November, 2016.

He couldn't he say TL confirm Piglet re-signed? He tried to make it a he says she says thing. Kinda sad. "
"Honestly still would have been okay with him leaving. He definitely bounced back from a poor first split, but the language issues and attitude problems that were prevalent weren't worth it. "
"noooooooooooooooooo freeze needs to go to TSM and f0rg1ven to TL





... wait, the fuck am I saying, EU teams need to stop being fucking pussies and pick them up with their riot $$$. fuck this ""toxicity"" bullshit, if ur shit tier top laner can't handle the EU saintvicious calling them bad then kick them "
"That was he saying that hes not shutting the stream off just yet. Didnt have anything with the team to do, i was there.
People have posted that picture in wrong context thats it."
No team in Korea is going to pick up a washed up toxic player
"How bad ass is the name Liquid Freeze, though? I'd be hype for liquid freeze."
I'm under the impression that as a player he was stellar but as a teammate he was difficult to work with. I don't think he was the main problem at all but having a strong personality who had trouble communicating with the team will make changes difficult
"why do people actually like forgiven? he takes a lot of resources. he refuses to play champions which are strong and has only a set piece of champions hes good on. and most importantly, he's a toxic douchebag that doesn't change. do you guys actually believe everything he tells you about himself being a nice player? he is the epitome of EU soloQ, just toxic hidden in passive-aggressiveness (""well unlucky bot sadly :))))"")"
Whatever team in China shells out enough money to pick up Easyhoon is probably not going to look for Impact and Piglet.
Curse fanbase in general sure as hell didn't want him when the offer was first teased
It could be said that Piglet was causing problems in picks and bans though. Like how they kept picking Lulu over any other decent mid just so Piglet doesn't explode every 5 minutes when he always overextends. 
"you heard him, reports say that there is water on mars."
"> Some one

It's written by Jacob Wolf/brayllcs. He's done this bullshit before and considers his false information to still be accurate anyway."

He's a decent player who synergizes poorly with TSMs current roster."

"Dear Support, you may be right, but stop phrasing all your posts on this subreddit like you are a master race and all ADCs are a bunch of incompetent retards. From ADC."
"Actually - rushing Beserkers on Caitlyn is valid in most cases if im able to zone the enemies ADC while farming my way to the first back.

With Caitlyn my goal isn't to directly trade with the enemies ADC, but to punish him for every CS he tries to go for with an AA. Beserkers give me additional movement speed to come in range faster and the AS to get off an extra shot most of the time. 

This comes from a Diamond Main ADC."
"Most of the supports I've laned with has NO IDEA when to trade. Like, no idea, and then they blame me for engaging????? Fuck you, learn the matchups first, then complain about your ADC."
"Dear support, 

So what if I buy greaves again ? Am I not allowed to do so ? Do you know me and the way I've been playing ? Are you adamant that I will get outsustained without a vamp scepter by two people without any movespeed ? And what if I'm Caitlyn ? Do you realize that me getting outsustained means that we are playing passively, which means that you aren't engaging trades to abuse the advantage i got from the greaves ? 

Why should I be the retard because I'm aimed at by a huge support circlejerk ? You can play ADC if you aren't happy with the way I build, or you can, you know, communicate, to know if I feel more like fighting, how powerful I feel compared to the enemy ADC, to adapt to the situation or my build. "
"Nothing worse than support players. Nothing loses games like support players. You can play around a shit mid, a shit jungler, a shit ADC, a shit top. Not a shit support. Yet so many of them are just content to sit a mile back from the ADC, effectively shutting their own carry down, to then do some stupid all in that forces the poor AD's hand into a suicide trade. A shit support means two useless people in your game. Laning is 80% supports in bot, and so just fucking suck at it even in diamond.

Nothing better than the once in a blue moon support main that can actually play the fucking role, buys a spellthiefs edge and earns more than 100 gold from autos in 15 fucking minutes and gives you room to last hit. You know, actually understands the game instead of getting carried or boosted to this league by their friends.

Then I go play something shitty like pre 4.8 Blitz and outperform the shitty support mains just by standing in a bush so the carry can farm and landing a grab. Fuck. I'd rather have the extra exp than most support players in lane."
"WRONG

You go back with 800 you get a dorans and a longsword. Same steal more damage.

Go back with over 900 but below 1550 and you get a pickaxe, pots or pickaxe, dorans.

Build to trade. 2 dorans and a longsword beats dorans + vamp. pickaxe 2 dorans wrecks whatever they return with. Even if they come back with blige you just stun and burst.

So dont play soraka support...wait why is this here.

Build to trade. Pickaxe becomes LW later. Go 5-0 in lane now."
Not gonna lie i used to do this on Cait when LS Quints were the meta. It made her such a bully in lane when you can't afford a BF.
"it all depends of match up what should you buy, vamp scepter isnt always the best as a firsy buy..."
"Holy shit, this is the most frustrating thing.  The other day I gave an adc 2 kills in lane and he went back and got level 2 boots! He could have gotten BF sword! SO FRUSTRATING! Support struggles"
"while we're on the topic of adcs gimping themselves, I often see people who are either losing lane or simply have an unfortunate window to shop rush boots 2 after the vamp.  While this is obviously not always a bad thing (for example, if you're confident with your mechanics to out-position your opponent or perhaps playing someone like vayne/twitch), it is often times a very easy way to set yourself behind.  Not only are you choosing not to get the all important first BF Sword, but you have to remember that once you spend that 900 or so gold you barely had, consider how long it will take to get back to 1550.

Again, getting boots 2 next isn't always a bad thing, I just ask you consider why you're getting them with a reason other than ""well i had 1000 gold and I wanted to spend it"". I know it's tempting, but there's a very good chance a less skilled adc puts themselves quite far behind by not waiting on that first BF Sword."
"but, if I don't get them how am I supposed to run and attack faster? "
"I didn't think that people rushed greaves, are you just playing with idiots?"
"dear support, if you attacked together with me while the enemy adc had much lower health than me, the enemy adc would not have sustain and we would win the lane. only because you are most often very unskilled we lose the lane when it could be won with a simple followup early on before any major items on the enemy."
It depends on what kind of lane you're running. Zerker rush isn't usually a good idea but vamp isn't always the best either. 
Who buys Berserkers on their first back?! I thought this shit happens only on pre-30lv games :O
But if i get more attack speeds then il do more attacks than their adcerino
"There's literally nothing wrong with early Berserker Greaves on a lot of AD Carries. 


God damn, easily the worst post I've seen all week. Actually, that buying food with IP post was fucking retarded as well. I don't know what to think anymore."
"I'm a Gold ADC and I cringe every time I see my lane opponent come back with finished boots and a vamp scepter. It's like why not just get the B.F. or vamp+second dorans or literally anything other than attack speed. Attack speed *usually* won't win a trade, sustain and upfront damage might."
"Or meanwhile you gave him FB and he comes down with a freaking bf sword, then its over anyway > hugging tower

But well i agree. 
2nd doran + boots + pots isn't that awful too but doesn't get you closer to big items

As jinx i go buy pickaxe with ~1000g sometimes :D. Not only  once my Oppononent thought he had enough hp and i ulted him on lvl 6 for the kill. its a nice buy just for jinx."
"Why are these threads always someone blaming someone else, instead of ""hey guys, I think everyone should consider the difference between poke, sustain and all in comps before they buy an item on their first back."" which might start a discussion, as opposed to a circle jerk or another spurt of negativity in this already difficult community."
"God i hate when my teams adc rushes beserker greaves, vamp secpter please.."
"You can't just generalise this... If I was looking for a hard engage when I got back to lane, maybe invite a jungler along too, then zerkers would pick up a double kill where a vamp sceptre couldn't."
"I always give that someone shit if they buy that.

Even more if they decided to buy an avarice blade and/or zeal even tho they had 2 kills and farm enough to get a bf sword just so they can get more money."
"I feel like only on certain champs, like Cait and Jinx can it be okay if you are going for a siege early, but otherwise it's stupid as fk and I cry every time I see it. "
This is probably one of the most retarded posts I've witnessed rofl.
"yeah I hate this and this, so imma gonna post this and that"
ROFL how retarded does an ADC have to be to rush zerkers
"Who the fuck goes back with 900 gold?

You either make enough for a BF sword or you die trying."
"Always depends on the situation. If you have soraka support or any support with a heal you can totally afford to do this, specially if you know you bullied the enemy adc enough for him not to have the 800 gold"
"I'm glad I'm an ADC that adheres to every smart support in the world. I love you supports, I love you. Green or Pink, I buy wards. Blue or Red, I buy potions. What's funny is, most AD Carries think they're superior than their supports. It's always the supports to blame, for whatever reason they want to tell you. T_T"
"Why the hell would people buy mana pots? 


And in some match ups, a dorans + long sword instead of a vamp scepter is a buy, worth to mention! "
Depends on the lane matchup and playstyle. If I' CAitlyn vs a bullied Vayne getting Greaves will let me harrass her more. I won't need mroe sustain than a couple of health pots.
I would go berserkers greaves first any day on cait/kog... If the enemy doesn't even have boots yet you can outtrade him and make him mad
"dear support, i want to buy what i want. maybe my playstyle is not trading like a retard and soaking hits as you wish it were. I know its hard to understand, but for adcs there is this term called KITING.


Yours truly"
"I remember when the idea used to be ""General Discussion is shit posts and idiots, let's go to reddit where there's a good community with quality posts!""

Where to next?"
"Dude, its not even CLOSE to some retarded posts that were reaching frontpage."
Every post with shitty advices from x to an ADC reaches frontpage as people love to hate them. Ofc there are many thresh ADC but i can bet my house not a single one of them reads r/leagueoflegends
"Because ADs are literally retarded and obviously have the motor and thinking capabilities of a 4 year old. Supports are geniuses with 2000 IQ who can't reach challenger because of their shitty ADs making mistakes. They can find their paradise here on Reddit with all the other genius supports.

/s

although in this case the sustain  is right in most of the bot lane matchups"
"supports fuck up just as much as adc maybe even more , there's nothing worse than playing with a support who doesn't know how to pressure the lane ou helps you cs under tower , but for some reason we're always at fault :( , our life is hard man ! "
"In this one specific case, it's because buying attack speed before attack damage is *factually inferior*"
But he's probably busy criticizing your choice of spending 900g on berserkers greaves.. And while trashing you in chat and doing nothing you will get poked 2vs1 and he will proceed to blame you for not buying sustain.. 
"on caitlyn, if you are looking to fast push and you are not receiving too much poke in lane (ie. your opponent picked like alistar/vayne or something), it's actually worth to get the attack speed to push down that turret faster

other than that scenario, it's a terrible first buy though"
Yeah but your mechanics would quite simply be much better than the quality of player the OP is playing with. So his opinion is skewered automatically by not having an insight into good ADC's. 
"Do you not run attack speed on your runes or something?

The 18% I have on my ""auto attack"" adc page is more than enough to do that without rushing boots.


If the enemy gets a bf sword and you have boots, you're gonna lose."
Yeah... so much hate for it and I think it works fine with Cait's range advantage. Jeez.
"this or 2 dorans, or doran and boots + pots. vamp scepter is fucking bad."
"People don't like to play support.

Guess what? It's not fun to babysit people which you know they suck the moment they buy the greaves."
I don't think you need to last hit; isn't there an execute passive where it kills the minion even if it's at half health?
"if you are forced to back with 900 gold, you're probably not snowballing though"
"This is completely wrong.

That part with adc = mechanics and supps= tactics is pulled out of the ass and lastly you even say that supports need mechanics to land their skillshots contradicting yourself."
Doesn't matter how much I farm when enemy draven has 12 kills by 15 min. 
I think your balance team is bad and here are my suggestions for PBE changes that wont go through as they are because the patch is in 2 weeks Riot. 
"I like that you can just /s after writing something that reddit would usually take offense to because it's the truth.  They're such easily manipulated retards.

/s"
"No support main skips a sightstone. if he does, he's the worst ""support main"" north of equator."
"Support mains are some of the most infuriating players i've played with(second to vayne mains)

More ignorant and better than you attitude is hard to find ""Well i willingly support so obviously im a better player than you"" Sure im generalizing now, but that trend came at some point and to the point i preferred to get some random guy who hates to support instead of a support main themself"
"tbh, attack speed makes caitlyn aa much smoothie than ever before "
"It's true that zerker rush isn't optimal for everyone but he isn't claiming that, op instead is claiming that vamp scepter is the right choice no matter what which is wrong and that is what thronsw was pointing out. The item you should be getting depends on your playstyle and knowledge of the matchup."
"Yeah but the OP is summing up that if adc are picking boots the dont know what to do and he is not saying that just a few are that bad and dont know what they are doing.  Dont know the english word but  its like he would say ""all bronzies suck"" just because there are a few bronzies which are bad or which he met. (i am also bronzie so no haterino plz)"
"You will never see this on high elo ADCs because trading isn't just walking up to the enemy ADC and shooting them. It's specifically timed when the enemy ADC is in the middle of an auto-attack animation during last hitting, which means Vamp Scepter will still beat Zerks."
"what if you double kill them 2v2 in like the first 3 minutes
or whenever"
"You know what's really fucking funny is that if you didn't put the /s you'd end up with ""negative karma"" or some kind of stupid reddit negative backlash simply for stating that the majority of them are wrong"
"You're doing it wrong. The /s means sarcasm. You pretty much said they're no easily manipulated retards.

The other guy was using satire correctly."
"I dream of days my team let's me freeze a lane. Normally they give you no help until the tower is gone, so they come try to gank the overextended enemy who warded the jungle up and leaves, so the gank fails. Then, they shove out the lane you're trying to freeze for no apparent reason other then they can. Not to mention they do it with no particular reguard to actually csing. They just want it to shove, and don't mind if half the wave you have stacked up just dies to other minions or the tower. 

/s

P.s. the s stands for salty"
"I personally think it's harder to win with a shitty ADC, a real shitty one, the kind who misses 50% off his CS and take every single fight even knowing he will lose them 100%. 

Even with a shitty support, you can try to stay safe and farm as an ADC, later on in the game you will still have your damage to try to carry. "
"that is good, but this thread is made like a complaint, or rather a passive aggressive statement out of someone's emotional struggle to comprehend that some people just want to build whatever they feel comfortable with and don't require someone telling them what and what not to do. 

classic example is Genja, in soloqueue any random person will get shouted at by their teammates for running triple dorans or rushing a zephyr. but when Genja does this it's suddenly completely acceptable, despite him having the same reason as everyone else for purchasing these specific items in that specific order.

He does it because it's how he likes to play, and he is very well aware that this isn't a meta-build or remotely optimal. but this is what works for him, if it is rushing berserker greaves, so be it."
You delay your BT/BOTRK and lose sustain to farm your first big item part(bf sword). If you have 900 always get scepter+ pots
"pfft. most of do hate everyone, but we try to keep quiet about it.
"
"What the fuck did you just say about me, you little bitch?...."
"The main guy arguing with me is a guy who hasn't even played a game of adc in ranked this season, I can only assume most of the downvotes are coming from similar people.  c'est la vie."
"Dear all lanes if you are losing your lanes before i had enough time to get 1st blue and red and you die 1v1 please don't blame me for not ganking fast enough when there jungler has not ganked you either also stop backing when the Fog Of War is all around you as you will get caught and die then you like to blame everyone but yourself.

from Maokai come water me some time im a tree!"
"Satire is not the same as sarcasm.

Satire  -  something meant to make fun of and show the weaknesses of human nature or a particular person.
Sarcasm the use of words that mean the opposite of what you really want to say especially in order to insult someone, to show irritation 
"
"I disagree. If you think about the mechanics behind the game you can easily see how a bad adc is more detrimental than a support. Assuming they are equally bad you have to remember adc is a role where the team funnels a big portion of their gold on. From that you can see that a bad adc effectively gimping your team's  economical value. All those big items your adc buy would be useless and a waste of gold. Support does not share the same degree of this burden due to lower income, less expensive item, and item scaling. 

It is also important to note how support and adc scale up as the game goes on. Support in most cases have linear progression or no progression at all as the game goes on. While the ADC hold an exponential scaling. With the game focus less on snowballing, we can see that ADC role has more impact on the game as a whole."
"That's what I was saying. Shitty support > shitty ADC. Because supports have nothing to distract them, their main goal is to help you so if they aren't helping you then they're doing nothing at all. Even a moron wouldn't just sit there AFK while his ADC dies. Also as an ADC you do the damage so it's easier to carry, and you don't have to rely on your teammate following up on your initiates."
"because they build to trade. You go back in lane with a pickaxe while the enemy got a vamp sceptre and pots and you'll win that trade. You'll zone them out of more CS or put your lane in a brilliant position to kill them - maybe even outright kill them. ideally you never go back until you get a B.F sword, and if you do it's because you lost a trade. If you don't build to out-trade them next time, they'll just do it again. You'll lose lane.

Forg1ven went in-depth into this on his AMA, it was very logical and did a lot to explain how he ascended so fast.
"
"When facing Caitlyn, high elo Vayne players won't stay in range of her auto attack unless it's specifically during last-hitting auto-attack animations.

Obviously there are scenarios where harrass occurs outside a last-hit situation, but the majority of trades don't, and to recommend an item build relying on the exception and not the rule is silly in my opinion. In fact not only does it rely on the exception, but it neglects the fact that the laning phase is far more than just two ADCs last-hitting minions."
but but but... their lee sin came here lvl 2 why didnt you ?!?!?!? 
"Going attack speed first on champions that get free attack speed isn't ideal.  She also doesn't really benefit from attack speed without lifesteal, so shiv first doesn't really make sense."
"Except Shiv gives Tristana crit, and really good waveclear. Also - If you can time it, the initial 100 dmg burst really does quite a lot in lane. Shiv is a great,, and actually recommended, first item for Tristana."
NOBODY TELLS ME WHAT TO DO!  I FOUGHT IN THE BIG WAR!
"Shiv and vamp is 3300g tho, BT/Bork is 3200g and gives way better stats. The only time shiv is viable as first buy is in a fast push meta. Else it's completely trash.

Also Crit is worth jackshit if you don't have any AD and having such a small amount in lane is putting so much faith in the RNGod. Why do you think it's optimal to buy BF and Pickaxe before Cloak when building IE on anybody but Yasuo? Other than the slot efficiency it's a poor stat to buy early unless you get like 3 simultaneous crits before level 6."
I'm still quite salty about that CIS vs SEA remake.
"Turkey just had to have at least 1 person in 1v1 top8. Their fault they didnt perform. Dont post these shitposts. It's Turkey's fault, not format one."
"People that think turkey deserved to qualify when they knew the rules from the get-go and could not get one win in the 1v1 tournament(be it 'cause they didn't try or they just got outclassed, doesn't matter) are just as retarded as the liquid bandwagoners that thought liquid should've qualified for worlds instead of C9."
Turkey knew the rules and could have just thrown the 1v1 intentionally. No point to complain about it.
"You're fuckin retard. If 1v1 tournament means nothing, then how come Kira carried his team to LA?"
"They knew how the points are scored all along.

Don't make it look like they just got scammed or something, CIS got more points fair and square."
"People find something to complain about everytime.

League becomes team oriented game - here come bitches, here they come: ""OH THIS PLAYER IS A SUPER HEAVY MECHANICAL GENIUS IF STUPID RIOT DIDNT MAKE THIS GAME SO BORING AND TEAM ORIENTED HE WOULD CARRY THE SHIT OUT OF HIS TEAM""

Riot allows 1v1 determ the outcome of the tournament: ""JESUS FUCK RIOT ARE U STUPID THIS GAME IS A TEAM GAME! FUCK YOU HONESTLY IM SALTY""

Never happy"
remind you that CIS win over SEA because some cheater remake 
"""Turkey did worse, I am going to cry like a bitch and demand that they still go to LA Allstars.""

Yeah.  Ha-ha No."
"I completely agree. Turkey was the best team out of the entire tournament by a mile. They deserve to participate in the main all-stars event. I hate the fact that the 1 v 1 tournament counts.....

EDIT: In my opinion and what other people have pointed out. Kira and Seiya should have both qualified for the 1 v 1 All-Star event in Los Angeles. They where the finalists and the 1 v 1 tournament already has 2 BYES so it fits perfectly. While Turkey should have qualified for the 5 v 5 tournament as they actually won it and performed the best out of everyone.

I'm just providing a solution to the whole unfair points system controversy lol"
"Usually this kind of headings would fall under the category of shitposts, but this time riot was a bit too stupid with their decision."
Guys dont be stupid this is allstar its all about individual skills didnt you see how kira stomped naru last 2 games ?
"CIS fans talking like they deserve winning the tournament ? If its not because of the bullshit remake the whole tournament will be more exciting. And riot did not have any apology or reply to SEA about the situation. 
edit : CIS knew all SEA strategy and they ban 2 champ from SEA old team comp and picking tristana !!"
"CIS  took 1st place in 1on1 and 2nd place in 5vs5
Turkey took 1st place in 5vs5 and 7/8 place in 1on1

CIS go LA, whats wrong?"
"This is not LCS, IWC, LCK, LPL or any other regular league man, this is ALL-STAR, and those are the rules and conditions to meet. I know its fucked up, but the LA Allstars will have a 1 v 1 too, 5v5 its only one aspect of the torunament."
"Why are people in the chat talkin' so much about the 1vs1's and that Turkey did bad in there so they don't deserve it.. 1vs1's are so random, it has nothing to do with skill. Naru is really good mechanically so.

Turkey absolutely destroyed the 5vs5 tournament which everyone should know means much more. The point system is just awful when Turkey gets 90 for winning 5vs5, but that a team got 50 points for winning a 1vs1 tournament that's random is ridiculous. Naru for example got beaten by Whitelotus simply because his pick sucked. People don't practice for 1vs1's vs random champs. They know how to 1vs1 the midlaner for example, as they know how that goes. But when Naru picks Fizz and he's then vs a Draven. When do you practice that?

How are people all for CIS winning based on points. When it's clear Turkey are the best. And no, I'm not Turkish. I personally liked LAC the most. CIS weren't awful, but it's clear that the Turkish region is quite a lot stronger."
"Agreed. I understand that 1v1 tournament fun for watchers but it is a bad idea to give winner 50 points while 5V5 winner gets 90. It doesn't show a region is strong, also even if it did it would not be this important. 

Btw, don't forget the fact it made the final 5v5 worthless. Like, atleast make the final 5v5 before 1v1 so it would have meaning. 

Edit: Also, Riot is like that kid at bronze who says ""1v1 me scrub""  and invites you to aram 1v1 game after game."
"**People saying that doesn't matter because its ""Fun"" tournament**

- The IWC teams are locked for a year to these shit Leagues were its super hard to actually get better since you never compete against the main regions, outside MSI...WHERE ONLY 1 OUT OF 7 REGIONS GET IN.....
- The IWC teams haven't gotten any invites to IEM events this year and they are just kept being shit all the time, because rito has developed this shit league system, which is ultimately costing them more money than open circuit season, keeping teams shit and minimizing international play."
"You guys are just figuring this out now? They spent an hour broadcasting a 1v1 farmlane featuring two mediocre casters yesterday.

This shit is amateur hour. I don't know why riot sanctioned/ran this but it is at such a lower quality than any other content they release. I mean is this a joke? They advertised a game mode where you troll your teammates by building sub optimal. Had a 1v1 tournament determine the outcome of a 5v5 tourny, and spastic immature fucks of casters screaming memes at each other.

Fuck this shit im out. "
"Turkey deserves it, 1v1 match should be for fun not to determine whose going to represent. I rarely join riot hate circle jerk, but for this one I will man up with my pitchforks!!!"
"ALL stupid tourament is just SET UPPPPPPPP.

Thats really dumb because 1v1s are essentially a different game. If you go on PGL and look up the top 16 players on the 1v1 bracket majority aren't even diamond in solo queue hence why its a completely different game.
"Man I'm so conflicted. How about we write it off as a stupid Riot decision? The winner of 1v1 should go, and so should the winners of 5v5. I don't understand why one would go over the other if they're two separate events. Is there no wildcard team going then? Just the 1v1 winner? "
riot is horrible at tournament organization. news at 11
Nobody can explain to me that brTT one shot away from killing Kira. He just took heal and didnot attack to Kira's caitlyn. It was unfair.
"Lotta folks can't wait to jump on OP and beat the shit out of him in this thread, yes the tourney was setup this way and yes TR knew that going into it, OP is saying the rules are stupid as fuck and I have to agree. You don't have to agree, but not even debating what OP is saying and spouting off irrelevant shit is fucking dumb. "
Totally agree. Biggest and dumbest fuck up riot has ever made. Absolutely a joke. 
What the fuck. Are u fucking serious??? Their b5 means nothing now??? Riots really fucked up with this tournament. 
"I couldn't agree more. It's a shame that Turkey clearly demonstrated they were the better team, and yet get screwed over by a cheesy 1v1 points boost.  #disgusted.  "
"Meh , nothing new here. Just Riot sabotaging EU again."
"Happy I didn't watch a single minute, knew it was going to be garbage"
I tough LoL is a team play based game not a 1v1 game. If you are not the type of ' Come 1 v1 me noob' player this shouldn't be your problem. Riot achivement was improving the team plays. This is not a fucking Fifa or NBA 2K. 1v1's should be for entertaining not a main goal. That point system was pure foolish
I dont think OP ever implied they didn't know the rules going into it. He's saying the rules are stupid. 
Riot hasn't even apologized for that stupid mistake.
"I would love to see how you react when you are treated unfairly. Have something taken away you feel you earned. I bet you do not think it is a joke then. Hmmmmm?

And before you send those nasty replies I do not care who won the all stars I'm just trying to prove a point. Everyone bashing on this guy for being salty, but the format was jacked and I have seen people rage for far less. Let him vent.



"
"I think everyone is blowing this stupidity out of proportion. Everyone KNEW the rules ahead of time. Kira took the 1 v 1 seriously. No one else did, now suddenly hold up change the rules!!!!! No. "
"the main issues is that they should have given less points for 1v1, but bonus points for the loser of the final depending on games won. That way they could have balanced it in a way where 1v1 is only influential if final is a 2-3 and the region who lost in the final won and they other have none in top4/8 that would be fair imo."
"> it's a huge chance to get international experience

You're the one who's making it out to be that. This tourney IS just for fun, and has always been: the teams are determined by a popularity contest through fan votes and it's chock full with silly gamemodes. 

Hell there's just as much time dedicated to the 1v1 and ultimate bravery showmatches as there is to the regular summoner's rift ones. 

If you think the entire thing is stupid, fine, but then why do you care so much about competitive integrity or whatever when all it will award these guys is the opportunity to compete in yet another tournament in the exact same vein (where 10v10 tandem mode is going to give 100 points alone, for example?). 

Either disown the whole concept of all-stars and give 0 fucks about this or care about it while accepting that it's nothing more than showmatches for the fans. 

>What is the fucking point of a 5v5 tournament with a bo3 grand final if the decision is made from a 1v1 bo1 side tourney? 

This was the single permutation where the winner of the 5v5 tournament doesn't go through to the main All-Stars, capturing the pommel is an absolute priority but you can't neglect that taking a beating in goals might make you lose the quidditch match in the end."
"If this tourney is that serious, why wouldn't Turkey take the 1v1's seriously? Seems to me that you're the only one making it this huge deal. They knew it was worth points, even though it was quite a bit less than the 5's, yet people are claiming no one took it seriously except the winner. Turkey didn't get a single player through to the next round in 1v1's, that's all they needed, so it's their fault if this is such a ""serious"" competition, that they didn't take it that way."
"Who the fuck told you its a 5v5 tournament? Its a fucking tournament where people play different gamemode.
Funny you call this bullshit when you seems to know nothing about it.

And that analogy gave me aids.
"
"CIS players are not at fault. CIS voting was stupid from the start, as it considered current teams (Lex and Dimonko were released from HR prior to voting), meanwhile big 5 league voting considered players teams by the end of 2015 season (thus DL is considered CLG for allstars, not TSM). Basically this fucked up some possibilities. I'd preffer Likkrit to go for CIS team, because Dimonko is very bad. Also strongest CIS jungler refused to go, due to studies in uni"
"The fault is riot's, its up to them to judge whether it was actually a bug or working as intended and riot made the wrong call. CIS did nothing wrong there."
"remind you team SEA used ward bug, 4 times in game 1, and after each bug game was stoped by riots. actualy team SEA continued to abuse ward bug even in game 2 and game was stoped several times too."
That's their fault then. It's not like they weren't warned.
"I don't think All Star is serious at all... No prize pool, no best players, it's a popularity contest.
"
"they destroyed CIS on game 1, I think they are angry"
"No they didn't.  This outcome was ridiculously unlikely, they stacked the points as hard as was POSSIBLE toward the 5v5 event without making the 1v1 mean nothing.  Any more points and it would have been literally impossible to win the 5v5 and not win the whole thing."
"I know point stystem. I hate this format. Whats the point of sending worse team instead of best team. 

All players on tcl significiantly better than cis players. We saw that in this series. 

1v1 was not determing any skill. It was just about champion select. Kira picked his champs perfectly. He is 1v1 champion but not best player we saw him vs naru that series. Naru destroyed him 3 out of 4 matches. He went 18-1 in first game w irelia.

Why kira cant go there as allstar repsentative? Why other 4 guys goes la allstar instead of better players because kira win 1v1 tournament? It makes no sense. If result is not best team went la then there is a problem with format?? 
"
"http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/IWCA_2015_Melbourne Turky fucked up 1v1, so they cant win. Their own fault"
"What? 1v1 determined 5v5 only because Turkey sucked the most from 6 teams. They got 0 points! How is it even possible??
They sucked. They lost. No more words."
"Turkey didn't get a single member out of the very first round of the 1v1 bracket, that's why they lose. Not like they didn't know the points system before they got into the tournament"
They knew the rules. They knwe they had to do smth on 1v1. They lost. They suck.
http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/IWCA_2015_Melbourne Turkey only team who has 0 players in 1v1 top8. Their own fault. They fucked up. They lost. Stop bitching
It was not just for fun. It gave points and everyone knew that when they entered the tournament.
"It doesnt. Thjis post is bullshit. http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/IWCA_2015_Melbourne
"
Why Turkey? They were the worst in 1v1 tournament. Worst from 6 teams. Cis performed in both formats. They deserved it more.
"Only Kira did good for his region though. It's only because he won the thing did they get more points for simply being 2nd place region. But not even close to Turkey. If he got 2nd place in the 1vs1 they wouldn't have went. Ye, that's a stupid system."
"Doesn't matter if they knew the rules ahead of time or not, completely  irrelevant to the discussion. The rules are fucking dumb is what OP is saying, you don't have to agree."
Only problem Turkey has 0 point in 1v1. They sucked too much.
"Ehh, if you look at OPs post history, it's apparent he's one of those ""TR>EU KEKEKEKE"" guys.  This entire thread is dumb."
Still more serious than IEM. Their participant selection is fucking garbage.
I cant tell if youre serious but judging Turkish citizens on the actions of their government is crazy.
"Thats actually hilarious, because the first thing I rolled is called ""troll viktor"". This game mode is for people who want to ruin normals and ranked games by building troll items and feeding their tits off."
"Yeah all the teams in this tournament are fucking garbage. I don't really care who wins. I'm complaining that stupid shit like making a 1v1 tournament have any standings for sending to all stars is a joke. Its an embarrassment that this whole tournament happened in the first place.

Great now some other backwater server can send token representatives that 99% of league watchers give NO FUCKS about.

Now go watch Tomatocanyon spit another spicy meme and lap it the fuck up."
Another thing that I'm quite salty about is that no one is bringing up about this incident and how the Pink Ward range is NOT a bug
"Finally someone i can upvote, this thread is garbage."
"Eu > tr what are u talking about

If you dont see how stupid is that format, i feel bad for you."
"They invited more teams that couldn't make it. And no, it's not more serious than IEM, it's not **objectively** more serious than IEM. As in, nobody gives a fuck about whether or not the players or teams or fans take it seriously, IEM is **objectively** more serious than the All-Star tournaments."
"It's not the best players. It's not the same as traditional sports' all-stars. The sooner people like you realize this, the better. It's a fun event for people to vote for their favorite players to go and dick around. It's a break from the seriousness of the LCS/LCK/OPL/CBL/whatever. Riot themselves have said this is the reason they created All-Star events. To provide content in the off-season and to take a load off and have some fun."
"> What in the fuck are you smoking? Give me some.

I want some too "
"stop talking bullshit, dude. pink still cover all baron pit: www.picshare.ru/uploads/151129/J5QW7Mlk6s.jpg"
"Im not even a fan of turkey, Im an GPL fan but this is just unfair"
"Turkey wont win a game at All stars and Russia wont aswell.... so u can choose between them and its obvious that the majority from EU prefers Russia over Turkey at any day. Russia is just a lot more European then Turkey in their mentality. 


Turkey should be flagged under the middle East and play for the middle east rather then Europe. Its a shame Riot calls them European."
There are a few threads about that match but it seems like no one cares. Just a Riot thing.
"The winner of the 1v1 picked the same 2 champions in a predictable tier list, always picked Caitlyn, if Caitlyn banned pick Lucian, no one banned Lucian so we don't know what else. Everyone knew exactly what he was gonna pick after the first couple of matches, they had the ability to counterpick him but they didn't succeed, they had the ability to mirror match him but they didn't succeed."
"And the 5v5 aren't skilled based, because the teams don't train together so it might be a bunch of people that never played together, or even don't like each other...so your point is?"
"Wait till it affects a team that the vocal majority likes and people be like 'Wtf Rito fix your shit that remake shouldn't have happened"""
"Okay, maybe it was unlucky, but that doesn´t change one thing. People seem to not get that the tournament was set up this way. There is only one way for the 5v5 winner not to go and Riot knew that. They won´t suddenly change their minds and the complaining is stupid, if you´re going to complain, complaining before would have made you seem more reasonable and not just wanting to see your region at allstars."
What was the straw that broke the camels back? Since just a week ago you were telling us to go fuck ourselves
"What is the need for them to be in competitive? If they were added to help with your stupid philosophy of anyone being able to win then why are they in comp, you clowns make no sense at all."
"No praise from me for this. You're merely doing what should've been done weeks ago. 

Vault the brute."
Starting a fire just to put it out after the flames are big enough to get everyone to look. GG. Naive ass kids are gonna eat this shit up too.
Still wondering what the hell they were thinking about brutes being first added
"Right direction, now just vault it. You tried something and it didn't work, listen to us now and remove it. 

Everything in this concept (Sword, Planes, Drum gun, Mechs) Just stop please... if you have to add that crap to the game for some reason add it to LTM ONLY. Literally takes 1 IQ to prevent this game from being Paragon 2.0."
Whatever I’m so over this crap it’s really put me off the game and I’m a shit player who usually just enjoys chilling and playing. It’s changed my opinion of epic. I started in the other mode and after the lack of what has happened there to now br the straw is broken
"The last two buffs are quite unnecessary, but it’s a good change all together. I won’t thank you for it because you put it into the game in the first place, but this is a good nerf."
Or you could just vault the stupid thing and put it in an LTM with planes and the sword 🙄
"Step in the right direction, but this its inevitable that it will get nerfed more until the end of the season when it gets removed entirely. Less rockets is good but they're still too high in damage (I mean 50 times 6 is still gonna kill me if they hit you, should really be like 20 per at most) and idk why it needed MORE health as if 1000 wasnt already too much."
Omg you guys are so stubborn JUST VAULT THE FUCKEN THING
Stupidity. Stubborn people with 5y at home that desperate asking about a win. Should remove shit like this from the game.
"Don’t be sheep, everyone. Although it looks like the majority here are seeing through this charade. This “nerf” came coincidentally during the item shop update which is  collaboration with Major Lazer. Don’t be fooled. This was just done to pacify the streamers because they aren’t streaming Fortnite and need them to promote the Major Lazer collab."
"No. You are too late, morons.

Maybe you make the game more balanced, but now you are the clown company that fucks over their competitive scene, the developer that caused their serious players to remove their payment methods, the ones that made the streamers rage quit and your pros be extremely disappointed.

Your long time players will never forget this BS that you made us go through. You obviously didn't ruin our lives. But you made us feel betrayed and stepped on. Big middle finger to you, Epic."
"JUST TAKE THE MECH OUT OF THE GAME. Been playing since season 1, and I’m ready to quit."
"There's so many people still unhappy, even with the significant changes to the BRUTE. Like, people complained about the mobility, the rocket fire rate, and the insane material farming. And now with those all nerfed, they're STILL unhappy, wanting it gone. The problems with the mech have been mitigated, or at least brought attention to to slow it down. smh my head..."
Everyone ready for the kill 5 people with a mech and kill 3 people in 30 seconds with a mech challenges next week?
"They still suck. And to be honest, as hyped as I was for season X, I think I am done with Fortnite for good. I guess if you make enough money you don't care about the people that gave you the money in the first place anymore.

I have no idea what is going on at Epic Game. But I don't care anymore. bb"
Call of duty and Minecraft did this. Do not thank epic game is still trash.
You're still a bunch of clowns. You've hurt this game beyond repair. No more trust.
"This game is still dog shit. They’ve fucked the whole game to try and make these mechs the centre piece. Mobility is at an all time low, this game needs at least quad crashers or some sort of small group mobility, nothing is worse than spending 15 minutes running from zone to zone just to die because you haven’t had more than 30 seconds to farm the whole game. YOU CANT BUILD IN TILTED, if this shit was pulled in season 3-6 we all would have assumed the devs were smoking crack. Retail row has the worst version of the horde monsters that have ever been in the game. Dropping a small fraction of the loot/ammo/materials that they have in the previous events with the highest volume they’ve ever spawned. Season X is a big pile of regression and dog shit."
Just get rid of them. They're fucking dumb and no one wants them
Just get rid of the brutes altogether you fucking idiots. Listen to your customer base.
Just delete the fucking thing you gutted it because of bitches.
yall mfs gotta get rid of the brute entirely like wtf its ruining fortnite because its way too overpowered
"to all the people saying to not praise them, i agree. but don’t be toxic. we got a very amazing change to these."
All these idiots thinking they’re gonna vault it. Lol. They’re not going anywhere until the next season
"This prove that you, epic, dont know shit of your own philosophy. 

If you really mean what you said about the #vaultmech a week ago, you wouldn't ever nerf this brute this much. 
Also, is not because you listened to us, you dont care anymore what we say, you only care about money and tbh this is fine as a company. And this is exactly what happened. You realized that in fact people are stopping playing this game because of this robot for N reasons, and it also means people are not wasting a single penny for your skins, and no new players are being introduced because even the most popular streamers are not streaming that much and/or playing other games because of this bullshit robot! 


This robot didn't just make winning easier, it also  damaged your game so bad. Too bad you took weeks to realize the second consequence."
"Do not praise epic, the laser was in a loading screen and they already had programmed a piece where the laser came out of. This was all planned, I am almost certain they expected the backlash and wanted it for publicity. Think about it, a vehicle with insane mobility and 1000 health and ability to farm 999 999 999 mats in 2 minutes with NO weapon would be broken. a vehicle that shoots 10 rockets in a meta with 0 mobility would be broken. a 1k health 2 player vehicle with a shotgun and stomp would be broken. You could take almost everything from the BRUTE and it would still be broken, the sword was NOTHING compared to this. Less health, less mobility, less damage, less farming and only 1 spawns per game in the same spot. Epic knew this would be extremely overpowered once released. What a disgraceful company. There should be nothing in this game other than a pump headshot and sniper headshot that one  shots someone. Vault the BRUTE and the junk rift"
"Every game tonight there was 4+ mechs off spawn, usually 5. One game there was SIX off spawn.  Prior to this update the most I would see is 3. Plus they have more health and 6 rockets is still enough to fuck you up"
I still think brutes should be hidden on the map like llamas. I hate when half the bus jump for a robot.
Still getting destroyed by the missiles just vault them
"Epic is so fucking stubborn when it comes to changes like the whole community is yelling in your face to vault this, you got top streamers rage quitting tournaments and deciding what game they should all stream next in the middle of their stream, almost all their comments mid stream are about the mech and you just won’t vault it?

Like I get letting other players win and trying to keep the broadest fanbase without stepping on too many toes but remove them from arena then it’s honestly such a simple fix. Like who the fuck is in charge and refuses to drop this horrible addition, because they need to wake up."
"Too little, too late. I haven't played since the first week and I'm invested in other games now, so there's zero chance that I'll be playing again. There's always the risk that I'll buy next season's battle pass only for some other similar bullshit to happen. Epic have lost my trust so I'm done."
"Not praising you guys at all. This has been needed since the first day it was released. As a huge company like yourselves, it’s embarrassing how you have handled this situation.

Your player base has been continuously crying and reaching out to you; however, you guys were reaching out to an entirely different demographic.

The past three weeks have fucking sucked in Fortnite. Streamers have quit tournaments, players have moved onto different games, and you have no one to thank but yourselves. 

You guys NEED to get your shit together. When a community is crying for help & change, LISTEN. LET THEM KNOW YOU HEAR THEM. It feels like a slap in the face when you roll out shitty ass updates and add broken items every week while we are begging for change. 

Your player base is loyal. They love Fortnite; as do I. But please communicate with us better. I have a hard time trusting you guys how, and I’m sure others can agree."
"Great they finally ""adjusted them"" but the spawn rates should be slightly adjusted to 0%. Also we complained about 1000 health, lets make them less powerful but they can withstand more damage which really makes all the other changes pointless imo."
This is NOT a strategic vehicle and will NEVER be unless any attack functionality is removed and it’s simply a vehicle to just transport with while defending the player inside like crazy
I've adopted a new strategy.  I'm reporting everyone who kills me using a mech in arena for cheating.  Thing myaswell be fucking cheating.
"Literally 3 or 4 of the top streamers rage quitting a $400,000 tournament yesterday was probably a big factor in their decision, plus the countless other complaints they've gotten from the community."
1/3rd of the competetive players and streamers quitting a tournament they were being guaranteed hundreds of dollars just for showing up.  Free cash wasn't worth playing this garbage.  Then openly trashing fortnite and epic on stream to tens of thousands of viewers.
"I think them seeing the mech ruin a $400,000 tournament made them nerf it."
"I get a go fuck yourselves, and now it's a little effort to make peace?  Whatever. Too little too late, onto better games."
They pull out this a >!!<lot. B.R.U.T.E. was the worst by far though.
"Except people are actually quitting more than I’ve seen in past seasons. Which makes the game itself worse because a lot of us use it in a social gaming sort of way. When our friends quit, it’s leading to us quitting.

I don’t think they’re trying to create controversy. Season X had massive buzz prior to the season. They nailed it with the battle pass and the map had huge potential. They could have coasted on the success and rise of bugha. Instead, they angered top streamers to the point of leaving their game. I don’t think they did this on purpose. They’re simply idiots who stumbled upon the biggest game of all time."
Yeah I saw all the controversy on the news. Lmaooo. This idea for PR with the mech is ridiculous. The only people hearing about this shit is gamers. This was definitely not for PR.
"Fuck ur arena, remove them from the entire game plz"
"This should be higher, 4 weeks of complete rage playing this game"
And they're only doing it now that the popular streamers are beginning to quit.
My game runs like absolute shit since the junk rift update. The mechs didn’t help but ffs please release some QOL patches. The stutter/hitching is unfuckingbelievable. These additions are just making an already poorly optimized game run worse.
"Why not? They can add/remove whatever they want from their game. It is not ours, yes I know without us they wouldn't have a game but there's millions of players that don't know about reddit and they have a bigger pull then users on this app.

I don't mind all the wacky items they have because I keep in my mind that it is just a game. This said, I do agree with the overwhelming population when they say it should be removed from arena.

I don't care the hate I will get for this, but yes we can praise Epic for nerfing the mech. They listened to the player base and made changes that seem really good."
"Yeah, fuck these clowns for taking so long and it's still not good enough"
"They decreased the damage it does, it's movement speed, the blast radius, and the spawn rate.

Thats why"
"My son basically quit because of the mech. Sure he’ll do creative but even that’s waning lately.

I was a Rumble player until they upped the spawn rate. I’m done now.

Fuck the mechs and fuck this season. Battle pass was an absolute waste since neither of us want to play anymore."
"People are happy with the nerf but unhappy that it took so long.
Epic is simply following this loop:

1. Release awful, unbalanced, game ruining item/patch
2. Ignore the community till they're screaming in your face
3. Nerf the item into oblivion and use the media attention and praise to increase stonks
4. Vault the item because they nerfed it so much it's useless and use the 'finally!' Praise from the community for stonks.
5. Repeat next season to get more stonks.

Players are unhappy because they're starting to see the cycle not because they hate the patch."
"They literally removed everything that made it overpowered. Suck it up, buttercup."
What have they said that makes you think they have treated us poorly? They haven't said anything to us specifically besides the original blog post where they explained why the mech is as it is. Never in that post did they say anything insane or mean or anything. I and I'm sure a lot of others expected every point they made in the post. You and your vault mech squad of crying children are so entitled its seriously so frustrating to see you complain all the time about things you aren't willing to either try or adapt to.
"Agreed, epic nerfed all the things that caused the most problems, and everyone still cries like it’s the end of he world. Smh

Go ahead, argue and scream and downvote, it only proves my point"
I'm guessing you haven't played yet. I played about 6 hours last night and the mechs were a zero factor in every single game. Sure they have more health but they are much less mobile. Nobody in my squad died to one a single time but we did shoot several of them to death.
"Mechs (BRUTEs)

(I'm good, I swear. Please don't ban me, mods)"
Honestly this was it. He was genuinely furious and quit a huge tournament because of it and so did others but he is usually known as being cool and collected
"They haven’t even activated our trap card, Nick Eh 30 rage quitting."
"I figured it was because of a mech, does anyone have a link to in game footage when he died?"
"ding ding. When you have your top streamers now playing Minecraft, CSGO, etc and you had your main official broadcaster rage quitting lastnight, quite publicly, and several major Comp guys AND celebrities (Marshmello, Jordan Fisher, etc) calling epic out then they had no choice but to do this especially with the Major Lazer collab.  

Add to the fact you have players dropping out of the Twitch Rivals event (Myth didn't even participate at all) and you got the Cash Cup...Yeah they need the eyeballs back on the game with peoples wallets open."
"To bad the major lazer stuff is total arse looking.

And we are still left wondering why the pepegamech is still in arena..."
People not buying stuff and boycotting the game.   I'm still quite P.O.d and probably won't play for a good while.
I doubt our boycotting did anything to their revenue
We didn't get played this time though. Most of us were suspicious already.
"They pushed it way too far. Sure, I get wanting to generate chatter and free PR by introducing the mech, but it was grossly overdone even by marketing standards. Their best caster had to literally rage quit for anything significant to happen. If Ninja still acted as he did in the past and didn’t have a deal with Epic, I’m absolutely positive we’d have seen a worse reaction from him. 

Terrible showing from Epic, through and through."
"I dont know if it was their strategy, but it didnt went as they expected now that everyone is quitting and playing Minecraft, they are fucking scared so they nerfed the mechs 

But honestly it might be a lil bit too late, Im pretty sure there's a good amount of players that are not coming back since they already like another game thanks to Epic

Whoever made the decision of not nerfing the brutes right after everyone started complaining, really deserves to be fired, literally made a shit ton of players quit because of that decision, fking clown"
Well it might work a few times but doing that every single season will most definitely kill the game in the long run
"Higher dash CD and reduced air velocity combined with less rockets dealing tighter damage.... for all we know it will be something a good player can build against and fight back. 

Making the brute more resilient with several major nerfs makes sense if Epic wants to keep it in the game. If they make them 100% useless they might as well vault them."
"> I think that when the Infinity Sword was vaulted, they had to scrap a lot of extra content that was supposed to play into the sword being in the game. Maybe they don’t want to have to do that again.

Not disagreeing with you, but if they didn't want to do that again they shouldn't have put some ridiculous shit in the game again."
"""We""

""Us""

May I remind you guys that the Drum Gun was unvaulted when everyone on reddit hated it, being loud and annoying doesn't mean you speak for the whole community, Brutes can be fun, same with Planes, not everything needs to be Vaulted."
"This community is Never happy

At least they’ve been nerfed"
"I mean, it is a step in the right direction. Doing literally anything to weaken the mech would've been a step in the right direction."
"I mean, this is basically saying ""Don't praise epic"""
Quite a few of these changes are things people have asked for though. Just because it's not what you wanted doesn't mean it's not what everyone wanted.
"Yeah this will still be cancer to go against especially early game. And they have more health now

And they still promote teaming. They should self destruct in solos when another player jumps in"
Problem is these people feel justified in their actions because the items get nerfed. The company cannot be thanked for doing what they want because they believe themselves to be the reason. This warped mentality is what breeds the toxicity
"Tfue, Tim and a few others including Marshmello have all quit the game or made a post regarding the mech in the last 24 hours."
"He ain't quitting, the fake ass robot is so sickeningly ""positive"" that he won't do that shit."
"[here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ctpfl1/streamers_quitting_a_400000_content_creator/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) 

This was in the middle of the twitch rivals tournament"
"Dakotaz made it clear on stream last night that he also stopped purchasing skins from the shop. It’s bad when these Fortnite dedicated streamers are getting no joy from the game they were dedicated to since it came out. Everyone hated when Wildcat stopped playing GMOD with the squad and started playing Fortnite but was something he really enjoyed playing, but even now he has said he’d rather watch other people play it instead of play it himself. It’s sad."
"Even with the nerf, on a 1on 1 against a 2man mech there is no way to win that fight if you werent lucky enough to find boogie bombs. Try to outbuild it? Stomp, rockets, mech booster.. try to shoot it? 1.2k hp, yea no thanks."
Oh they would never make an item worthless and keep it in the game right????   lol
Yeah honestly I hated them pre-nerf but post-nerf they were pretty enjoyable and very good for rotating
Hes having it rough. Rage quitting his main game and then getting slain by Syndicate in Minecraft. He just can't win.
"yep, man will suck donald mustards dick for a pro am invite"
"I played, but haven't used the item shop since season X. Not that it's even been tempting since the item shop has been trash for a while now."
It wouldn't even be so bad if he hadn't publicly stated on stream that FNBR as an eSport would be exactly what the players want. *Clown* doesn't even begin to describe him
"Lmao this. Those bastards scare me, I can't control them without looking at the controls all the damn time, so I just run away. My brother's trying to teach me how to get better (I'm not) and I just gave up yesterday. Ran towards it, hoping to deliver some damage, all while knowing I was going to die. He was mad I didn't try to self destruct but tbh I'd rather just start again"
Planes got done dirty and should have been unvaulted
Planes were trash after the nerf. Some guy could sneeze across the map and a plane would blow up.
"You're naive I'd you think this is them learning and correcting this mess. THIS WAS THE PLAN THE WHOLE TIME! They're doing this same kind of thing ever since season 5 with the overpowered SMGs.


1 They release a garbage patch

2 let outrage take over resulting in a huge social media reaction

3 After killing time for a while, they patch it periodically to varying degrees, in order to maximize the amount of attention they can get from the outrage

4 nerf it and reap the praise from the people who dont understand that they caused the problem in the first place.

5 repeat 

A step in the right direction would be them announcing a change philosophy and directly stating that they will (in some way) embrace the skill gap between competitive and casual players."
"<RETWEET>
shit i thought that was how to make big text mb"
Not gonna disagree. This further proves this subs toxicity is ridiculous and ultimately unnecessary
I can feel his rage man.. thats how i feel with the fucking combat shotgun. That shit should have been vaulted rather than the tactical AR
"Not really, nobody saw me in the bush, if I was in a mech I would have died so fast"
Nah I was laughing as got my first mech win watching as the last guy desperately clung to life spamming 90s butnl sadly there was no escape no wining only failure. 😭 good times were had with the mech oh well.
"Mechs are 10x more obnoxious and game runining that planes ever were. Ballers were also worse than planes, bust mostly just annoying, where the mechs are absolutely just unfun and break the game."
At least they get something. Most mods will get jack shit.
"Yeah, getting a benefit that they probably really appreciate, that Epic was not obligated at all to provide, and which sets them apart from most internet mod squads who get paid nothing. You're just hating to hate."
Selling popcorn for 5 Vbucks for the shitstorm of complaints that’s about to happen here 
"Complaints incoming in 3... 2... 1...

...


*Due to recent feedback, the boombox has been vaulted.*"
I JUST WANT TO FIND SHIELDS! STOP ADDING USELESS CONSUMABLES 
"It’s becoming so apparent that Epic regrets making building an essential mechanic of this game. It seems all they add nowadays is detrimental to building, because they hate that the skill gap is growing and their precious casuals quit because of it. It makes me quite sad to see them ruin their own game with every new addition. 


Edit; I’d like to add that I really enjoyed the ground mode from a few days ago. It was refreshing and nice to rely on nothing but your aim to eliminate others. But there needs to be a separation between a normal game and all this wacky shit. It just gets more out of hand with every update. "
"The players: 


“We want some time off where instead of adding more content, please just fix bugs in the game”


Epic:


“Here’s a boombox that takes an entire mag to kill and destroys your builds”"
"Holy shit. Epic .. Set your priorities straight for the love of god. There are a billion balance changes that are so obvious and are still not made. Something like player damage when ramming a structure with an airplane, turret removal, zipline interaction key. So many things are not added that are much more needed than a music box that destroys builds, this will only bring more complaints to cover up the old complaints regarding current problems."
"How about letting this farm mats too, so it’s not just used for destroying build fights"
"“Heya guys, we messed up. Thanks for calling us out on it. We have vaulted the boombox and we will revisit the chance of idiotic weapons in the future” "
"A boom box? Seriously........ a fucking boom box.... worst idea besides the sword...

Would rather have a dildo launcher"
Why do you guys troll us?!? At least once a season theres an item that deletes builds that no one likes that forces us to play less and sit here and bitch until its gone. Theres no way this could be released with the thought it would go over well. Back to RDR2 like the sword week I guess.
"Hey. I’m confused as to why there are SO many items that can destroy builds? What is the point of building anymore in this game? Dynamites, boom boxes, planes, quads. Why can’t you accept the fact that new players will have to learn how to build? Every update seems to be catering to new players."
"Popo, we need a state of development of some kind. Really badly.

I’d really like to see what the development process in terms of how new items are curated and developed and also the process of evaluating balance and fixing bugs. I think we deserve after these generally poorly received fiascos (sword, plane, turret, now this boom box) to know how decisions are made and your intentions for the future of this game.

If shit like this will continue to be the norm, and I can expect a game breaking meta shifting fuck all item every week, I need to know. I deserve to know. If bugs aren’t fixed and quality of life isn’t at the top of your list, just tell us already so we can stop holding our breath.

Get your shit together. Take a breath. Talk to us. Please."
"Boi what in the fuck is this?????

It doesnt destroy ""newly built structures"", it just destroys everything, in a HUGE radius.  It also has 600 hp so it basically never gets destroyed until the timer is up.  And why have them drop in 2 stacks?  This is what we get for not pushing back harder against dynamite.  They added dynamite, we were like ""okay, thats annoying but manageable"" and Epic just keeps pushing and testing our limits.  Its annoying as hell and we already have like a thousand antibuild items and vehicles. For fucks sake its so blatantly and unapologetically broken."
Halo needs to come out. Fuck off with adding an endless amount of pointless items.
Why are they adding more items that ruin the fun? They REALLY need to have servers where certain individuals can try out new items and determine if said item won’t ruin the game.
Whoever the fuck at Epic decided that the game needed 30 different ways to counter building needs to be fired. 
Planes still kamikazing my builds and now we’ve got an item specifically designed to fuck with building. Can someone at Epic explain to me why exactly they despise the one mechanic that makes their game successful? Building is the ONLY reason this game has exploded. Because the shooting mechanics are trash. So how about stop trying to destroy your game ey? Cheers.
I wish you guys would add the reasons for adding each item. Every single damn time I'm about to start getting back into the game and grinding scrims and stuff you just add this bullshit out of no where. It's so unmotivating man I just want a balanced game :( too much transperancy 
This screams “let’s give the new Christmas player something to counter people that wreck them with any minor building ability”
"If you're upset that players are outbuilding casuals too much, why not just make Ground Game permanent? I'd be happy as hell to play Ground Game every day. And it's much better than pissing off a bunch of players with broken items. Literally a win-win. Those tired of being out-built can play Ground Game where their shooting skills matter much more, and those who spent a lot of time practicing building aren't screwed over. 

I get that this is quite literally Epic's first time trying to balance a popular game (since their previous titles weren't exactly popular in comparison to CoD, Halo, CS, LoL, etc) but it seems like balance 101. Halo had an MLG playlist and had ""laid back"" playlists in addition to ranked. LoL has ranked playlists and laid back playlists in addition to a super-laid back mode where there's only one lane. Changes the way the game is played similar to putting a very low mat cap on a mode in Fortnite and keeping the mode. 

But no, we want to please our investors and don't want to split the largest playerbase in the world(that can definitely afford to be split). After all, X amount of players playing solo/duo/squads looks a lot prettier when you have some extra zeroes instead of having a permanent casual playlist. 

I love the fact that you can build some cover and build ramps to get to places. Or extend floors to be above opponents. What I *don't* care for is having to carry broken items that piss players off simply because I don't have time to get great at building. Just give me Ground Game. "
What the fuck were you thinking when you introduced an AOE 'No build' Spell to your BUILDING game?????????????????????
Another counter to building all the trash players can use. fun
"Epic clearly didn’t learn anything from the failure of:

• Redeploy 

• infinity blade

• C4s

• Turret

• explosive damage update"
"Finally me (the casual player) doesn't have to do anything apart from throw down a boom box and mindlessly shoot at people. I now stand a chance against those idiots that... what was it called again? build?

"
This is rediculous. Terrible content after terrible content. Planes still an issue and numerous bugs unaddressed. Wow Epic you're really trying to screw this up aren't you?
"Epic! Stop fucking around with your game!

People usually moan and complain when the game they're playing is unbalanced and full of bugs/glitches.

Fortnite tends to be on the whole a fun, balanced game with very few complaints - until you add shit like this in.

Sometimes less is more.

Leave the game alone for a while."
I miss complaining about the drum gun and spray meta
Boombox that destroys structures? Why is this a thing?
No one asked for this. No one wants it. Remove it and fix bugs and glitches. 
"Fortnite: “We need something interesting to freshen up the gameplay.”

Employee 1: “Maybe we release bug fixes and improve stability.”

Fortnite: “GTFO.”

Employee 2: “Boomboxes. Let’s take our game and fuck it up with boomboxes, so noone can build yah know? It gives noobs a chance to win games without skill.”

Fortnite: “Employee of the fucking month.”"
Can't wait for the fly by boom box drops to destroy builds 
The worst part about the boom box is I’m hungover and it hurts my head
What would happen if turbo building got took out the game? Would it stop all the anti build item coming into the game? I get out built all the time but don't like turrets planes and now boom boxes I'd rather learn to try to out build players than use something to handicap them
"Oh great, more bullshit that counteracts builds. As if the planes, grapplers, turrets, and minigun weren't enough. Great team!"
"If Epic is so worried of the skill cap, why not create a permanent ranked mode? Also, for new players, wouldn't it be nice if there were tutorials? Low budget BRs have them, why is Epic holding back? "
I swear I'm legit about to quit this fucking game fuck this shit I'm out
"People : planes shoudn't destroy buildigs, sword shouldn't destroy buildings, explodes are op because they destroy buildings, stop adding items that destroy buildings!!!
Epic: *adds boombox*"
Lol at everyone calling others noobs as they cry in their 1x1 turtle box.
"Every single comment here is basically saying, ""what the fuck epic?"". If this isn't immediately reverted it's definitive proof epic gives no fuck about the people who play the game. More loot dilution and anti-build bullshit for the 10 year olds that use parents credit cards for v-bucks. It's actually disgusting."
Why is every update a nerf to building. This this is op and you have to peak for a insanely long amount of time to destroy it. RIP comp
"Planes, turrets, TNT, now a boombox that destroys builds instantly, what has this game come to??"
more broken shit to break down buildings with lmao are they THAT determined to destroy their own game?
Builds are already easy to destroy. This isn’t needed. This game continues to go in the wrong direction. 
Epic needs to stop focusing on  adding more things in the game each week to nerf building and instead take out have the weapons in the game and fix the bugs
"As much as I try and stop myself from complaining about this game...

What. The. Fuck. are you actually doing.

Sure I dislike how people spam builds 24/7 but damn we don’t need to outright remove it from the damn game. This is a like the sword situation but toned down drastically, but still a problem. The community hates and and we’re probably gonna have to sit here waiting while Epic has their heads up their asses (sure they are on holidays but chill with the items.) fix some bugs or something we don’t mind those just stop trying to change the game constantly."
Lol wtf kind of idea is this? A boombox that destroys structures? Really? 
"Epic: You didn't like someone having 400hp with a sword that tears builds? We hear you

Also Epic: Here's dynamite-on-steroids with 600hp that stacks up to 6. Get rekt complainers

&#x200B;"
Hear me out. Crazy new concept! How about the men and women over at epic add new items to the game that don’t completely destroy the games core mechanics? 🤔
Wait this destroys enemy structures? Lol so i guess this is the new item the community will complain against 
Dont mind me just retaining the <50% like ratio. I've said it in the past updates but I'll repeat myself: Fuck you for ruining another great game over corporate greed.
"Horrible. Epic, your player base is constantly asking that a break is taken with the new stuff and that bugs in the game be fixed. We're not stupid, you're not gonna get away with ""early access"" forever. "
"Ziplines: Broken

Planes: Overpowered (and broken)

Drift board: Not in the game

Epic: BOOMBOX LMAO FUCK BUILDING WE’LL VAULT IT IN TWO WEEKS AND IGNORE EVERYTHING THATS CURRENTLY WRONG WITH THE GAME"
"I hope the idiot at Epic coming up with these STUPID ideas gets tossed out of a top office window.

Tom, these ideas are shite and we dont want em.

have you ever thought of taking VOTES(edit: from the community) before adding dumb stuff?"
"Epic just gave me the perfect end to 2018: a full thread full of build-fighters STILL being surprised that Epic is trying to give people options to counter build-fighting after [a post about this in June](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/counterplay-and-play-styles) and a long series of proposed additions and tweaks like buffed C4, clingers, explosion damage through walls, minigun tweaks, heavy snipers, mat farming changes, quadcrashers, quad-launchers, stinkbombs, shockwave grenades, turrets, dynamite, balloons, rifts, portable rifts, port-a-forts, port-a-fortresses, glider redeploy and planes.

Look, I think we all agree that right now, if it's you and an opponent in a 1v1, and you don't build while your opponent does (or you just build worse than them), your opponent will win in 99% of all cases even if you have better guns, more health and whatever else. It's easier to replenish walls than it is to destroy them, and as long as there is a wall between you and your opponent, you're essentially not going to damage them. There is no other strategy in this game that is more universally powerful and hard to counter (except with itself) than building.

The part where the disagreement starts is that the people who spent a lot of time on practicing build-fighting think that that's the way it should be while the people who can't or don't want to play the game this way are little more than walking targets.

Here's the thing: Epic has said that they are looking into ways to balance the game to make building not one of the single most dominant strategies in the game. I feel that far too many people aren't looking at this rather simple big picture and instead blindly protest and stonewall almost every individual change Epic is making in that direction, and then they act all surprised when the changes are getting more radical. If especially the competent builders here made constructive suggestions to restore balance or reacted with any sort of nuance beyond ""OMG VAULT IT NOW"", we wouldn't have to deal with so many massive additions being blindly sprung on us.

This game could have been in a more interesting and balanced position by now if not every single addition was reduced to the questions ""But how will it influence my ability to have undisturbed 1v1s in epic build-fights?"" and ""But will I still be 100% invulnerable while camping in my 1x1 box with turbo-building?""

But the harsh reality is that Epic knows at this point that the build-fighting enthusiasts will completely lose their minds regardless of whether it's a relatively small or a large change, so I guess they feel that there is no point in being subtle anymore.

(Edit for a bit more semantic clarity in the ""Here's the thing"" paragraph)"
"This needs a nerf.  200 hp stacks of 2, caps at 2 or 400hp and drops in stacks of 1, caps at 2.  Also, far more significantly, should be placed directly where standing rather than thrown.  Also radius is far too massive.

As it stands, you can throw them and just mow down enemies, pair it with a quadlauncher or rpg, toss it down from highground, and basically guarantee a kill.  

"
"so fucking dumb, what are the idiot devs thinking get this bullshit out of the game."
"Hate epic devs at this point, they are brain dead with regards to making their player base happy. "
"I have played this game significantly less this season. Because its dogshit. Epic are terrible developers. 

Like why is this the one game my rtx 2080 randomly freezes in? 
Let's add planes and boomboxes so theyll forget build lag and microstutter "
"So much performance issues, bugs, and crashes since season 7. Add this to constant social issues, this game is trash compared to its former self. "
Fortnite does know that big bass drops and edm aren't really as cool as they were a few years ago right?  The marketing on this is even bad. 
I feel like this will be amazing when I kill a camper with it but its op and should be vaulted when I die to it.
"I get out built in battles but from turrets to planes to boom boxes I would rather get out built and learn than use these  ""Fort"" has gone from the game, hide behind a tree hope for next circle with a weak enemy "
"Thought we were done with trying to nerf building? How much more do bad players need to ""counter"" builders... They end up just dying regardless. "
Can't hear haters over the loud sounds of the boom box.
It takes increased damage. A pickaxe does quite a bit of damage to it. You'll do more than 30 damage shooting it with your assault rifle for example.
People usually stack shields. If you want some kill someone. 
When season 7 stars it was ate stard of having really hard time with looking for shield 🛡. When I loot paradise I can get 20dynamite 5 balloons and shield to be 200hp but in pocket I will have only bandages... Looking for shotgun is next hard thing.. Sometimes in squads we looking for them something like 2 circles for 4 fcking green pumps
And still no SLI support. Would have helped me just to achieve 144fps from my legacy cards 
"This one legit made me laugh. I'm actually more annoyed with the quad launcher than the rocket or GL these days. It's not that great for dealing damage, but it's incredibly annoying to build fight against a player spamming the QL. "
Probably to bring more complaints that cover up the old complaints regarding current content issues such as airplanes and ziplines. smh.
"Because they're trying to find a good counter against build spam.

They tried with rocket splash damage, and people freaked out.

Then they tried with the Infinity Blade and people freaked out.

Now they're trying with the boom box and... people are freaking out."
">It’s becoming so apparent that Epic regrets making building an essential mechanic of this game. 

They just don't get that fortnite is a building game first with shooting mechanics second not the other way around. 

Fortnite's shooting and gunplay is awful without building. With bloom its an RNG fight, building is what makes fortnite special. "
"Then they should nerf auto-building. All this bullshit started because they allowed us to build 20(!) times per second. 

We don't need to be able to build 20 times per second. 10 is more than enough. "
It’s so frustrating to play this game as a competitive player with all the stupid shit they keep adding. 
"Dude seriously... Like I wish I could say fuck you and leave till it's gone. But soon as I'm home from work it's like well I'll play a little bit, 4 hours later I'm frustrated and pissed off and I'll do it again tomorrow"
"Nope. Destroying buildings easily acts against the noob. When you are new to the game you can't build well and buildings provide cover. And not having cover -because someone blew up every building- makes you a much easier target to a good player. 
If they put the boom box in the game to counter excessive turtleing in pro games it kind of makes sense. But no way this or dynamites gives an upper hand to a new player in any situation."
"They are doing it for new players, which is stupid because you can just add a league/tier system. That way pros and noobs no one will complain. S03, 04 was fun, they need to look into current/old problems, and stop with this new contents. No one is asking for new content, every week, once in a month its ok. Balance changes every week is fine. "
To oppose the trash players who only know how to build
"Yeah, not sure what the problem with an actual ranked mode is, will solve all their problems."
I hate this direction away from the core mechanics.  This game is a shell of it's glory from seasons 3 and 4.
"Obviously people are gonna use the items they're complaining about. The reason they're complaining in the first place is because it's BROKEN. Why choose to not use a broken item? If you don't use it, someone else will use it, on you."
"The only thing that needs to happen is to vault this shit.  The loot pool is diluted enough already, we don't need C4 v3"
Early access my ass. They just keep the game labeled as early access because either they’re lazy or they want to have a simple and lame excuse. 
I agree completely. You have to be fully aware of them when you're fighting near one. Crazy shit will result if you accidentally contact one in a build fight. Sometimes it just sends you flying in a random direction! 
Death threats over a game? Really? Get some help dude
Anyone who watches the video of it understands how dumb it is. Only epic can be this brain dead sometimes. 
What’s the point in that. Just less health and same amount of damage. 
"You’re so full of shit, I can’t believe anyone would entertain this garbage. "
"I swear that the shield dispersal is messed up, not necessarily the spawn rate. 
Some games I will find no shield in a drop, others I find 6 half pots in a single location. Especially profound in duos. "
"It’s sad that they just can’t keep this game alive. Stop adding shit items, and fix this broken shit. "
I really do hate the final circles are 5 people building a tower and just taking pot shots at each other. Whoever has to run the furthest is at the severe disadvantage when the circle makes long sweeps in the smallest size 
But why not just throw all the noobs together in unranked and give people who actually want a challenge a Ranked Mode 🤔
It’s really fuckin stupid and caters to 8 year olds 
Look at my recent post I talked about it and now I’m getting hate lol
"But there *are* counters to building. There's fucking plenty, dude. Explosives, planes (which need to be taken out), hell you can fucking *shoot* builds you know?"
"It's not, it's why I said getting there. I think a 600 hp large radius building killer is a step into that direction. "
"The skill gap between apparently ""you"" and little Timmy is too high, more people who play this game are casual than sweatys like yourself. I think k boomboxes are a welcome addition to the game they fit right in with the wackyness that makes this game fun. And when all the new people get frustrated with the skill gap they quit, then only the sweaty and salty remain and this my child is how games die."
"The game is called Battle Royale, not Builder Royale. All I want is a way for console keyboard players to get their own fucking lobby. I can accept getting out built by a controller, but fuck off if you have all 4 walls hot keyed."
"No it's not ready to go. It needs more fine-tunining. The Driftboard will be available in v7.20.

&#x200B;"
Lies on the internet are not allowed so idk how is that possible 🤔
"I think the conspiracy is this: the sword was released in an intentionally SUPER OP state. The backlash against it was so immense and unanimous, they had no choice but to vault it.

But now the precedent has been set for the amount of outrage that leads to a vault. Obviously nobody will be as upset about this as they were the sword. Same things for planes.

I firmly believe they've been doing this for months now, but the sword was really never meant to stay in the game more than a few days. It was meant to lower the bar for what people will complain loudly about.

This game is slowly going down the shitter. They don't want competitive play, they want little Jimmy to be able to kill skilled players with gimmicky items like planes and this stupid boom box nonsense. Feels really shitty to have sunk so much time into getting good at this game over the last year just to have it negated by some bot flying a plane into my build battle. It's just gotten worse and worse. As a bonus I've rekindled by love for R6S so that's cool I guess."
"> Only thing i'd change about them is to make them interactive

That's the problem i'm referring to. Not giving them an interaction key makes them throw you out sometimes and kill you. And no it's not a rare situation, they throw you out a lot.
"
"I used to play PUBG. To be fair, Epic takes out new stuff if the community REALLY hates it *cough* sword *cough*, but this box will probably join the planes' club where it's controversial but not enough negative feedback to get rid of it."
Tbf at least pubg fixed their performance issues. Fortnite seems to be getting worse each patch.
"Then you can't pubstomp the noobs anymore, Reddit tryhards don't want that"
"See, that's what people miss. They only focus on getting good at one aspect of the game, for fortnite that's building, and when the devs try to change it up a bit, they loose their shit. I'm a competitive player, and I think the boom box is great, it's both fun and cartoony, and it is a good counter to turtling. The people who complain about it are the people who only think about how they are going to kill the bots and noobs and only take guns and meds, without thinking about how they are gonna survive against people who are better and taking mobility items. "
"I don’t think anyone knows which leaves a ton of room for debate and argument. Sure no gaming companies really owe an explanation, but with Epic’s track record of adding wildly unexpected changes wouldn’t hurt to know what they really see for their game, not just the open ended statement of “a variety of play styles”. 

Like, is ranked on its way? Are they serious about competitive? Do sweats in their mid to late 20s not spend as much money as kids with parents? Thus they’re catering to the less skilled? Or does anyone really know if the building nerfs are aimed at comp endings? Are they trying to nerf building so there are less players in tournament ends because they can’t fix the game optimization? Or is it an entertainment factor? Are they trying to optimize it?There have been so many partial comments that people just say shit based on how they interpret it then Epic’s blanket answer to all these questions is a Boombox. That’s it, a boombox that breaks builds and makes me bunny hop with a shotgun. The bad habit I spent months trying to break.

:("
"lol right? Pretty sure I can build, but I’ll blow the hell out of a guys structure who “just builds lol”"
"Rocket launcher + balloons is a very deadly combo.

You can sneak up above people and just shoot at their feet. 

Also works with AR as most players build around them first before they notice the fire is coming from above. "
R6S you say? I’m new to pc gaming (coming from PS4) so I might have to check that out. Anything to get my rage away from this dumpster fire of a game epic seems to be turning FN into. 
"You're giving Epic wayyyy too much credit and also not making any sense. You're saying Epic is intentionally adding stupid stuff to the game, but then adding even STUPIDER stuff in order to distract us from the original stupid stuff? Why? The sword was 100% meant to stay in the game... every sign points to that. They built an entire area around it's location. They had it in all of the promotional material leading up to the season. They showcased it in Winter Royale Finals. Even with thousands of complaints about it, the lead designer at Epic was trying to keep it in the game, and when all else failed, they removed it and stated they intended to add more Mythic weapons in the future (and most likely add the sword back)

There was no evil plan to add the sword only to ""up the precedent"". They just don't know what they are doing. Maybe the internal metrics they have are showing that when they add new crazy items, player count rises temporarily... so now they are on this never-ending push to keep pumping out new crazy content to keep those numbers up.

I honestly just think it's an upper management problem. Someone is telling the dev team they need to come up with new ""wacky"" items and release one every other week to keep the game fresh. So we get all this dumb stuff added with no regard to how it will affect balance, because to the upper management, balance isn't something they are concerned with. Money is. New content = People wanting to check it out regardless of whether it's game breaking or not. It gets butts in seats. At least, temporarily.

There's absolutely no reason for them to want to trick us into being okay with some dumb addition to the game by putting the attention on an even stupider addition to the game. They can add whatever they want. They just don't know what they are doing."
"> They don't want competitive play, they want little Jimmy to be able to kill skilled players with gimmicky items like planes and this stupid boom box nonsense.

Lol at y’all trying to take this game seriously as a competitive scene."
"> Not giving them an interaction key makes them throw you out sometimes and kill you.

It's also pretty annoying when you're gliding down.. You'll either hit it some times or you have to mess up your drop some."
"I'm not even  bothering anymore trying to improve. I've been practicing and working on my game for the last 3-4 months and I don't feel like I've made a lot of progress. Pretty frustrated and I'm losing motivation as a whole.

Even improving my aim that doesn't make up for the fact that taking a gun fight with a guy behind cover while I'm exposed and unable to build is bad and incredibly risky. "
"I have the opposite opinion but that's not what we are talking about anyway.  New items and environments are fine.  Clingers, jump pads, traps, SMG redesign, all of that added to the game.

Creating a new vehicle (in a game that shouldn't have any) that is the most mobile item in the game, carries an entire squad, has a powerful cannon with unlimited ammo, can easily destroy structures with no consquences and without warning, allows its driver to heal on the move with relatively little risk of exposure, provides glider redeploy, and knocks enemies thousands of feet in the air without providing glider redploy, and shooting it down requires using all your ammo and mats and putting yourself at risk of third-party, and getting shot down only means losing a little health and ultimately better positioning on the guy who just used up all his ammo...  and they're in ample abundance.

That's messing with core gameplay.  It fundamentally fucks everything up.  That's not Fortnite."
What’s wrong with them? I use them every game and have had zero issues
"When we say competitive, we (or most of us) don't mean taking the game super serious or sweating a ton, we just mean being able to play the fucking game and have fun without getting killed by someone with a quad launcher in a plane. It's getting worse and worse, and this chain of stupid patches and additions is what's gonna cause the game to become a wasteland inhabited by only the people under the age of 12."
"Yeah. I really liked glider redeploy. And a poll showed 50% hated and 50% loved it. But this sub reddit made it seem like 100% of the people Hated it and they took it out. 

I really like boom boxes. However this sub also seems to doing the same for it as they did glider redeploy "
"Dude you’re kidding right? Zip lines don’t connect sometimes, sometimes they connect and drop you,  right away, sometimes they connect and drop you to your death, sometimes the animation for the magnet stays above your head. They launch people, not just little launch either, they will throw you off your mountain completely and sometimes they throw people off the map entirely. "
Half the time when I try to jump onto a zip line it just connects for half a second then drops me to the floor to die. This also happens when I’m on a zip line and I try to jump to switch directions. 
In my experience they do none of those things. Not sure what incentive I’d have to lie about this.
What is this? Why change your unique core of the game that you have over all the other br games. I don’t like the mat & lama nerf! I was actually hoping they would revert that. Don’t go downhill like h1z1 to satisfy the complaining noobs who don’t put any effort in improving. 
"Dae said it himself, versus twitch streamers and good players you'll burn 700 mats in a fight, with building caps we'll be forced to avoid fights to ensure a victory royale. After every fight I feel drained of mats, and so do my teammates. Might as well promote even more camping now, or just a playstyle leaning less toward pushing. Does epic's ""variety of playstyles"" include camping?"
"> most other strategies are being drowned out.

Put smokes and shopping carts back in and I'll show you some alternate strategies!

*apococart now!*"
"The building is what differentiates Fortnite from other BR games, it's a shame to see that they want to change it, rather than embracing it."
"There's so much RNG in Fortnite, why try to nerf an aspect of the game that takes skill? If you want to change the meta so drastically, then you should be talking to pros and asking for their advice. This diversion from the current meta fees so forced and unneeded. Listen to the dedicated playerbase that frequent this sub, we're upset for a reason and we hate how you think you know what's best for us."
"Yes, kill your game before it kills itself. Good one EPIC. "
"The problem I think Epic is trying to address is the fact that the skill gap now between even a decent player and a new player is so huge that it disincentivises any new player from investing a lot of time into the game.  

I think they're going about the problem the wrong way in limiting building because that's what makes fortnite the game that it is but until they are ready to create a real solution to the problem (e.g. ranked play or an actual Elo system) the skill gap is just going to get bigger and bigger and they will just keep putting bandaids on the problem until they kill their own game."
"If EPIC keeps changing the core gameplay, from a skill based game to a more noob-friendly game, the community will slowly lose interest.

Some of the Nerfs make sense, but I have a feeling they want to cap materials.

I have to wait and see, but I dont like the direction Fortnite is taking recently."
Dont do this epic. Your gonna kill the game. If it aint broke dont fix it
"Wow epic is about to Fuck up real bad, dont they realise that fortnite is ass without building..."
"If Fortnite dies this year, this will be the decision that kills it. "
"I'm quitting if they keep nerfing materials, the only reason I play this game over other battle royales is purely because of the building mechancic. Thats what makes this game unique and fun. Epic listen to your playerbase PLEASE."
"Epic, your decision makers are morons.

You keep showing that you have no idea why people like certain LTMs, or why they like your game.

Idiots."
Besides build fights and sitting in a 1x1 what other strategies could there possibly be? 
"I quitted PUBG because of the building mechanics in Fortnite but if they are gonna nerf it again, I will back at PUBG. "
"I thought it would be impossible for epic to fuck up fortnite, they've gone and done it though."
And that skill gap will keep shrinking and shrinking :(
"I think this game has probably passed its peak. 

I used to hate building. After practicing, I find build battles the funnest part of the game and this is what makes it unique from other battle royals games. 

Building is the biggest part of the game and EPIC seem to be doing everything to prevent it. "
"Everyone: “stop nerfing building constantly”

Epic: “lol now mats will be capped further” 

How are they rlly tryna take away the most skill based part of this game? And a huge part of what makes this game so successful? It sounds so stupid to me. Tf do they want to replace it? Whoever has the Scar wins? What other “strategies?”"
"No one installed fortnite because of the incredible shooting mechanics, we joined because of the building aspect. Kill building, kill the game, simple as that."
"This shit just makes me sad tbh. This is literally the most unique experience on the market right now and they are going to trash the entire core of the game to promote ""other styles of gameplay"" lol. That shit just sounds weird.  

And I'm glad this post has 0 points. Idk whos making decisions over there but they need a swift kick in the ass 
"
Stop trying to accommodate new players with building nerfs. Fuck the new players this is supposed to be a building battle royale
How to kill a game 101. It's like Epic doesn't even browse this subreddit anymore.
"The reason shotguns, rockets, and building are dominant is because they aren't largely influenced by RNG. Other third person shooters have accurate guns with recoil. Shotguns and rockets aren't too strong the other weapons are just too random to be reliable.  A lot of the time there is no reason to try and use the assault rifles when its entirely luck after your first shot. If the random shooting mechanics were addressed or actually discussed by epic then they could become a more viable option. "
What the flying fuck are you doing epic? Don't cap resources build offs are fun as fuck
You smell that? It's a familiar one. It's the same shit that happened to Paragon that got shut down due to very unwanted changes and refusing to listen to the community. You read it yourself. Resource caps/nerfs. The core mechanic of the game that everyone strives to master cause it's the only thing that separates us from the average. Especially with bloom existing. You've dropped the ball yet again Epic. 
Resource cap sounds like a shit idea. Why are you trying to destroy an already good game ?
"why don't they like the mechanic that made their game famous, fuck epic "
"Wow. Whether intentional or not, the tone of this message comes across as quite arrogant and condescending. If that's the way they want to take the game, good luck I guess. But there are much better ways to say it than by basically taking shots at your core community. "
Epic acts like most of us don’t snipe an enemy or laser them with our ARs and THEN we push... there are already so many strategies in place. Not sure what “strategy” is being overlooked...
They are ruining this game lol. Shotguns are horrible now and I've stopped playing weeks ago.
"Hi

Do not end up like Destiny 2 went. If you are skilled, you should be rewarded. Destiny 2 took away everything that gave skilled players an advantage and now it's a borefest with a high floor and a low as fuck ceiling

I have yet to see someone who is proficient in building go ""this is an awful way to play the game"". Whenever I see someone complaining it's because they haven't adapted that playstyle, or didn't like it, or are not good enough at the game

Fortnite is unique because of this building.... don't screw it up; really"
"If they put the resource cap on 500 I will quit. 

Building is the heart of Fortnite and you are slowly taking it away little by little. Why? To help out the people who just started because they complain on this forum and twitter all day about the building? 

Finding other ways to win games should be based on the players and strategic thinking. Not stirring the meta to being gun based because bloom is luck and screws you over most of the time. 

You can mess with everything else but building should be off limits. "
If you nerf resources more than they already are then the game will be dead. The jet pack already made a chunk of players quit and move onto other games. The shotgun nerf has made another smaller chunk of players quit. Resource cap nerf? Might as well remove building while you’re at it. This is not the correct direction of the game Epic. Remember what made you popular and stop trying to fix what isn’t broken. Add a PTR so you can test dumb shit like this and stop forcing the entire player base to deal with mechanics that are not fun and not core to the game!
This makes me so upset. They are changing the game so much I honestly might have to move onto a different game... which would piss me off because I’ve put a lot of money into this game. If I knew the game would change this much I would have never bought so many items.
"I’m so confused by the idiocy of “not every fight should be a build fight” 
Yes the fuck it should, I’m playing fortnite for 1 reason - build fights."
I for one am done putting money into this game until it’s clear what this actually means for Fortnite Battle Royale as a whole you can’t just take away something that makes fortnite what it is that’s just wrong! 
"I don’t think epic understands that building is what separates fortnite from other BRs. Without it, all were left with is a shitty bloom mechanic. What does epic even mean by varied playstyle? There really only three possible playstyles: aggressive, passive, and hiding. You can’t just make one out of thin air :/"
"I find their statement reasonable.

A lot of people complain that the meta keeps changing, but having a stale meta is pretty damn stupid as well. 

They're absolutely correct that most end game fights revolve around shotguns and rockets. Build fights can be fun but it gets ridiculous a lot of the time when a game about killing/surviving involves 1-2 minutes of spamming walls/stairs to get ever so higher than your opponent and whatnot, or just spamming walls in a 1x1 until you or your opponent run out of mats/ammo. It's quite DULL and lessens the involvement of actual gunplay.

I'm sure many will disagree with Epic's decisions as well as my opinion, but varying up the meta and playstyles is, IMO, vital to the life of this game. "
High Ground is only Viable if both people want it. I don't need high ground to still kill you.
"Don’t understand the direction epic is going right now. Building is what makes this game fun and different. If you take away or heavily nerf the entire foundation of why people enjoy playing this game how is that going to fare?

Have to assume this is all because fortnite is the biggest game on the market right now, so naturally it attracts a lot of new players who inevitably will mostly get destroyed by established players who build on them. Epic definitely wants this game to have 0 skill gap so everyone can pick it up and play and not quit the same day because they die instantly every game. Money grab moves here IMO :/."
"Yeahhhhhhhhhhh, killing off build is making me lose my interest."
They are going to kill this game if they go in this direction 
Nerf building more? It’s already dumb hard to get a lot of materials 
"In fortnite, the whole build mechanic means burst damage is going to be king up close. The gun that is going to be used the most is going to be the gun that does the best burst damage. Epic is trying to nerf shotguns without realizing why shotguns are used so dominantly. I fear that if there are no good burst damage guns in the game close-range fights will become sluggish and awkward."
Yeah lads a resource cap will be the first and final nail in the Fortnite cap. This game is fun because of building. This game is popular because of building. This game will die if you fuck around with building. You’ve got a winning formula. I’ve heard literally nobody request that this game become a basic bitch shooter. Which is what some idiot in your HQ seems to be pushing for. Love the game. But the day you cap resources is the day I’m done. Because it’ll be the final confirmation that you’re committed to killing off this game.
"Way to ruin the game. Your game is popular and unique because of the CURRENT state it is in... Continue to fk with current state of the game and see it go downhill with COD and BF BRs around the corner. 

-You wanna experiment? Hire some testers, do not push things live and expect us to test for you.
-You want to be noob friendly? Deploy that playground and let noobs learn there.

Many of us started fornite because of building aspect of it, not gun fights. and lets be honest, your game mechanics suck for a fair, top of the line competitive FPS gaming. 
"
"I'm dumbfounded at the hubris epic has, they will be the ones to kill the game."
"You can try to reduce dominance of shotguns and rockets all you want, but if you make building less dominant you are going to create more frustration than balance. 

Lower resource gain rate? That just leads to very frustrating early game encounters and boring farmplay.

Lower resource caps? That just introduces more RNG - if you happened to have to get in a build battle right before encountering this other player you just lose.

Building speed decay or cooldown? Arbitrary, reduces skill from building, just changes emphasis of the build battle from an extended, long, tense battle to an artificially shortened one. 

Items that can overcome building? Now you have a possible solution. Grappling hook, ways to explode the build, ways to get down safely... "
"This comment section reminds me a lot of /r/Fallout, who also got extremely pissed at the developers without even knowing what they're doing. Keep theorycrafting, keep getting pissed at absolutely nothing"
"This is stupid, I suck at building and I don’t try to do it very often but if someone has learnt to build well protect them self etc they deserve to beat me"
"I’m willing to see what Epic can do. I’ll bitch if they fuck it all up, not before."
"If they keep nerfing the materials it's going to slowly, but surely, kill the game. Playerbase is going to move on to other BRs."
"Solution: Add a matchmaking system, so new players don't get turned off the game when they're matched against god builders their first game. That way people can actually learn to build at a realistic pace rather than being thrown in at the deep end. I'm 300 hours in and I still can't build because I'm terrified of build battles."
"I used to hate building, mostly cuz I was hot garbage at it. Truthfully, i’m still lukewarm garbage at it. BUT:

Since getting proficient at building, I find myself WISHING I could build in other games I play. literally, in red dead redemption thinking I need to build a ramp to get on a roof. Sometimes I even start to tap the buttons needed to build, then have to remind myself, “sorry buddy that’s only in fortnite”. 

Building is fortnite. 

Instead of adding caps and nerfing, give players other ways to succeed than raw building. The bounce pads, launch pads, and even jet packs (RIP) helped to counter build gods. Keep getting creative there instead of “fuck it, let’s make it suck way more for the people good at building”. "
"Build fights are probably going to stop happening. Those are the most interesting of fights. 

Well I guess we will see how it goes. Also you should probably change the name of the game then. ""Fort"" doesn't really work anymore."
This game is fucking terrible without building. It's literally the saving grace of the game. Every single other aspect is significantly worse in fortnite than other games. If they nerf building enough I'm out
"Honestly who fucking cares. This dead has been on a steady downhill path since the end of S4. Let's be honest, the past few updates have been SHIT.


Epic says they listen to us, but hell the fuck no. Remember shotguns and jetpacks? Fun skybases? That shits gone. Remember how everyone loved blitz because of more mats? Now they wanna nerf building.


Epic needs to get their head out of their ass and realize that the building aspect of the game is what differentiates it from most others, but they clearly don't.


Who cares at this point. I've been here since S1 and had a good ride. Barely play now. I'll play maybe once every couple days.


Looking forward to the 5+ BR games coming out this year that will stomp this game to the ground"
"This is the fall of Fortnite :( didn't think it would happen but the more they cater for below avg players the more this game will suck. I get the game needs to be fun for everyone, but part of the addiction and fun of the game is trying to get better, as it's such a difficult game to become reasonably good at. It doesn't need to be for everyone though, if people don't want to put the time in to get better when they suck they can go back to Minecraft or roblox or whatever lol..."
Cap resources (300-500 each) and give bonus materials on kill. One kill rewards you with 100 of each material on top of what they had to begin with.
"I hope Epic as a whole can read the room and realize this is not something that the majority wants. I hope they trash this whole fucking idea, but I can see them trying to stick to their guns and try to say ""after much feedback from the community we feel as if this is the right direction to go"" "
"they're going to kill the core of the game: high skilled players/streamers who are the culture.

once they aren't satisfied they leave. Then kids leave."
"You only are going to piss off the builder+shotgun combo fanatics, which is the only viable playstyle at the moment. 

A change to the shooting had to be implemented months ago. The building also needs a big overhaul to make way for new playstyles. The double ramp rush is to hard to stop when players are at medium distance, The turtle mechanic is just plain stupid, because walls spawns too fast and the shotguns are too agile and accurate compared to everything else. The endgame was just shotguns and explosives anyway. Also mid range is just get shot and built to not take further damage, but after that nothing happens at the range, because both targets are untouchable by the walls. 

The materials don't make sense in the current iteration. Wood is way to strong, because it's easy to mine and it gives the same amount or better protection than the rest. Metals not sensible to mine, because it takes too long and doesn't give a lot of benefit to use. brick is used the same as wood, but has less health at the start. If they want to make a lot of playstyles they have to use a penetration mechanic based on bullet type and materials so the guns other than shotguns have a chance to compete and turtles don't take ages to take down."
Not to mention the **terrible sound design** (verticality etc.) that is rather unacceptable in this day and age.
"Literally why I hate playing the big hot spots like tilted. I prefer to get to midgame or late game without a cluster fuck of who got the better gun half the time. I enjoy building and the post.. sigh, killing the unique mechanic this game has.

People like jao and myth got really big partly due to their crazy build mechanics. :/

Love this game for the fact that you can outplay multiple people if you're a build god."
The building is what's keeping me tbh... This game is shit without that
"Exactly this. If even more of my fights come down to randomized shots, I’m getting the fuck out of dodge so fast it isn’t even funny.


I’ve always said this game was going to be killed by epic themselves lowering the skill gap way too much..."
I'm terrible at building and decent at straight forward fighting. I still hate the idea of more material nerfs. I'd rather just get better at the game. 
"In a way, Epic ruining Fortnite is a good thing. [This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/NYP_LOC5.jpg/1280px-NYP_LOC5.jpg) was the original Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan, NYC before they demolished it to put [this](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170415074402-penn-station-stampede-false-gunfire-reports-wxp-hln-00000000-full-169.jpg) in its place. This travesty gave way to the NYC Landmarks Preservation Act whose purpose was to save treasures like [Grand Central Station](http://www.oddcities.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/terminal.jpg) from a similar fate.


Fortnite is the demolition of the old beautiful Penn Station, providing a textbook example to all future game developers as the de facto example of what *not* to do to your player base if you want to not destroy a massively successful franchise."
Exactly. I remember watching Dakotaz's first win video. He built one wall and hid behind it while the other guy did the same. It's crazy how far the building has come. This will just kill the game. 
by the time D2 becomes good this game will be trash  :|
That would be a bad solution. The meta stays the same now everyone just spends the first part of the game farming all 3 materials. And then we would get bored and quit playing.
"Same here, this is my most played game.

Epic are trying to cater to noobs. Look what happened to Destiny 2 that tried that. Went to dog shit and all the dedicated players left.

Epic are going to kill their game if they go with anymore building nerfs "
"They have experience with killing games, look at Paragon. People loved it at launch, then they took out everything that made it fun or unique (run mode, verticality, etc) and then it was just a bad version of smite. And Epic wonders why it died."
Kinda felt it coming with all the noob items and the upcoming LTMs. They're gonna make the playerbase feel like less building is the way to go. Effing morons appealing to sub 1.0 kd players with single digit solo wins that buy every cosmetic in the shop with mommies credit card. 
"With some of the suggestions that come from this sub, I’d problem stop listening too. "
"100% agree. I definitely am getting a ""this is the beginning of the end"" feeling. I hope I am wrong but given Epic's track history (Paragon players warned us of this)...its not looking good."
"I said it to someone else but yeah, building is the only thing keeping the game going with their trash bloom mechanics. If they nerf building before they fix shooting, RIP"
"Yea, considering how disappointed I was in the new gamemode I was looking forward to some good news or something. Now I'm just incredibly worried and just sad about all this. "
If they keep removing the thing that actually makes the game skill based yeah. The only reason bloom isnt a game ender is that shotguns and building is so prevalent. If they put in a lower resource cap and leave bloom as the fight decider this game is fucked. 
I laughed at someone who said this weeks ago. I just didnt forsee Epic actively trying to kill the game. 
"6,000+ games and $250 in skins I’d hate to throw it all away but I won’t invest more time and money in a game that will suffer the same fate as paragon "
Agree completely. This will completely kill Fortnite
And this is exactly how their other game paragon died. They kicked out the brilliant creator and idea man and brought in a fucking moron that changed things and added things no one wanted. 
The only fights that end without a build fight are against total bots where you build a wall-ramp and kill them immediately. I guess epic thinks these fights are more exciting than maneuvering and editing fights. 
remove bloom and make aim duels based off of precision and skill as opposed to RNG? why would we do that when we can just ruin another skill gap in building? jesus christ.. i swear every good game these days eventually ruins itself by catering to casuals
"People vastly overrate how much skill building takes. Yes, I can build for those who might ask, but hear me out and see if you agree:

Currently, the game drags ass when people get into build fights. Watch any streamer who pushes aggressively like Daequan and you'll quickly see how inefficient and predictable build fights are. 9/10 it's literally just burning 900 mats to kill some half assed player they could've easily killed earlier if they took some more risk--this is why a lot of players ARE good though, they stay alive by minimizing risk by keeping high ground. Right...keeping high ground, so every build fight is just who has the most mats and who can keep building above the next guy. Everybody already learned this trick. It looks like this:

\>double ramp over the guy and drop on him,

\>He 1x1's with a roof and then door edits and double vertical ramp pushes out sideways, turns around, 1x1 into wall and continue to escalate.

\>The other player reacts and doesn't want to give high ground, he continues to escalate higher and either does so or was too slow and is now under. Now he does the same shit the other guy did and goes higher.

\>This continues on often enough until someone runs out of mats and CANNOT go higher, they get knocked down by some bush potato or they realize they're too high and launch/bounce pad out.

Mats are the strongest weapon in the game. I should note, I currently dislike how much you have to farm to replenish or get mats in the first place. You want to know one of the main reasons I suspect why people reminisce about ""old Fortnite""? It's because the game was simpler, people didn't engage in these spammy ass build battles because most didn't know how, and those who could felt the power of being gods...and now that everyone knows how to play like this, it's not so fun is it? I don't think so. Fights were a lot cleaner in the earlier life span in this game.

I don't hate this game, nor do I hate the build meta, but I see it getting staler and staler. What this game lacks is decisiveness. I'm not at all impressed by the spam building, people do it because they have the mats to do it and building feels so powerful and unique to this game that they can't see how bloated the meta is from building. This is why I love the C4 changes they made, it's so good and satisfying to blow someone up who tries to ramp push me. I love just destroying people's buildings--especially when I'm low on mats and can't afford to build up.

Here's what I want to see, if anybody is still reading at this point. I want to see faster resource gain, but lower mat caps. I want to see battles decided much more quickly and brutally. Currently, players can just spam mats to stay alive and delay their inevitable death because they aren't better than the other guy. It's true, even a half assed player can survive Ninja or someone comparable attacking him for a little bit until he runs out of mats.

I want the outcomes of battles to be decided much more quickly through efficient use of mats and better predictions by good players. I don't want to see build battles neutered, just decided a bit more quickly and decisively.

PS: Also fuck Epic for not even trying shooting test 2. I waited for a truly new shooting model since October and they never delivered save for that accidental leak. This current shooting model is dookie, you can nerf shotguns all you want but people use them because aiming is trash in this game. Coming from CSGO to this game was a huge switch. You want to nerf building? Let me turn around and 3 tap somebody in the fucking face with accuracy, that'll teach them to put up a wall after shooting me in the back."
"I hate landing tilted, despite that shit show suiting my playstyle, because the audio engine is so horrible. I was playing games 20 years ago with better directional sound. "
"Epic has never been good at sound design. Take Gears of War. 10 years to improve, they didn’t even try."
"Yeah this is the solution. I'm fine with giving players the tools to win without being a master builder, but I don't like continuously reducing the amount you can build by nerfing materials, and this is coming from a player that's not very good at building. 

I usually think the people that complain about this game being catered to bad players are being hyperbolic but I don't know, kinda starting to agree with that now. I'll withhold judgement until they actually make more changes but I see cause for concern. I think another solution is some skill based matchmaking in its own playlist, not nerfing building materials. "
"I am in exactly the same situation. The building is a fun and unique feature, but at this point it's used more than guns. 90% of encounters now for me involve someone taking a shot, someone building a panic 1x1 with an ensuing slow build battle where a third person sweeps up. 

"
"Thank you so much for this post. And it's not just build-offs that are exhausting, because that's at least a sweaty skill-based fight. My major gripe with the game is when you have the advantage on someone, but no explosives and not enough mats to rush them. You're shooting at them from a good position, and they just keep spamming walls to block the shots, so it comes down to how much ammo you have vs. how many mats they have.

Maybe I'm just not a very good player and there's some better way to counter that, but those fights are so boring to me. I'm fine with build battles staying in the game, but IMO there should be a cooldown on how many times you can spam a wall in the same exact spot. That's the type of mindless build-spamming that I think they're nerfing mat gain to try and prevent, since it makes ARs less of an option than running up to someone and shotgunning them. But there has to be a better way besides forcing people to farm more."
"You could just wait to see what they do, then get sad if you don't like it."
"which will suck, because d2 pvp will still be as bad and laggy as ever. going to have to play cod or bf5 for pvp now"
"I actually just came here because he was talking about it in his recent stream. They’re going to lose excitement of streamers if they keep doing this. It’s the most exciting aspect of the game to watch, and probably to play for them. I’m a very mediocre builder and I hate this nerf, and was hoping they’d go in the exact opposite direction. 

Nick can go through 1,000 mats so damn quickly. I’ve already noticed a change, where more often he’s been in the middle of an intense build off, low on mats, so has to drop down and box himself in. We want the exciting build offs. This is ridiculous. "
"Yea I would just sit and farm til I had max mats at the beginning of every game, just to spite Epic. "
"BS. No one farms. Everyone drops tilted or salty and just tries to get kills asap. 

The mid game has been dead in this game since tilted came "
Read up on what epic did to Paragon... This company has done this before and it killed Paragon. Fortnite is next uo
"If Epic turns this into a third person shooter over a building game, I’ll probably just quit."
">People weren't really even building back then. 

What do you think made it so fun?

Eventually people figured out that the best strategy was charging at everything with reinforced ramps and shotguns, but before they did, there was a brief period where building was just for climbing mountains and building small little forts to fight out of.

Now every single build fight is the same, you just rush to the high ground and reinforced ramp. I kind of miss the old way, but I don't envy Epic trying to figure out how to bring that back, because it's really tricky."
"I get what they are saying, they want more strategies to be viable. Then **BUFF the other strategies instead of nerfing the current ones**. 

Make smg's so ridiculously strong that shotguns aren't the only consistent close range weapon. Make them so good that you don't HAVE to carry a shotgun all the time. 

Change the shooting model. Get rid of bloom and add a recoil system. Reward people for having skill and learning to control recoil. Make it so that people don't HAVE to push all the time with shotguns because they are the only reliable guns in the game.

Nerfing shotguns isn't going to make the shotgun meta go away. Nerfing materials isn't going to make the shotgun meta go away. 
Nerfing rockets isn't going to make the build fight meta go away.

Buffing other playstyles will. This is something they should of done a long time ago. 

Edit: Just felt like adding to this. 

**Want being stealthy and sneaky to be a viable strategy?** Give us a full loadout of viable silenced weapons. Give us a silenced AR, make it so that bushes give you more cover and are harder to see people in. Make it so that we can sit in trees more effectively making ambushing people more viable. 

**Want us to use AR's more?** Give us a proper shooting system. Make AR fights about skill and not luck.

**Want us to us to use shotguns less?** Give us other viable close range options that can compete with shotguns. 

**Want us to use snipers more?** Consider making sniping less difficult. A lot of people don't bother picking up sniper rifles because they aren't good with them and they don't want to put in the time to get good with sniper rifles. Yes this would lower the skill ceiling for the hardest gun to use in the game, but if you truly want more diverse gameplay you're going to have to consider this. 

**Want us to big massive forts like you showed in 50v50 trailers?** Buff materials. I've done this strategy tons of times in squads. My team and I will land at Fatal Fields and get 999 wood and brick, then wait until the end of the game and build massive forts that literally use upwards of 6,000+ materials. It's insanely fun and very effective. I'll try to get a game tonight showing what it looks like. 

**Want us to do cool and creative tricks with bounce pads, jump pads, impulse grenades, etc?** Increase the spawn rate of those items so we can actually use those items. Let us carry more of them. If you want us to use impulse grenades more, give us more impulse grenades. Trust me if you make impulse grenades spawn more I'm going to use them more. They are very useful, but the problem is that they are hard to find. And it's just not worth sacrificing a slot hoping to find a full stack of impulse grenades when you could of carried more shields or other items. 

By saying ""we don't like the current meta so we are just going to nerf the shit out of it"" doesn't please anyone. It makes people not want to play your game anymore. I love the current build fighting meta, but I could also see myself loving other meta's/ strategies if they were actually viable. 

You have the opportunity to make a game that will go down as one of the best if not the best game ever. No other game has ever blown up this fast and this large. I get that you have a vision for this game, you don't want it to turn into nothing but repetitive build fights and nothing else. I agree with that, in 3 years from now build fighting isn't going to be as fun as it is currently. What's going to keep this game fresh is new ways to play, new weapons to use that create new opportunities. 

Yeah the jetpack was overpowered, and so were the guided rockets, but guys think about the way they changed the game. You could rocket ride yourself, hell you could [LITERALLY rocket ride yourself across the map.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMGFjOlAnPg) You could build to the skybox without fear of getting shot down. Yeah they weren't very fun to play against, but they changed the game and added something new.  We don't want game breaking items to be added in the game, but we do want items that add something new to the game. And ironically, the guided missile is one of the best weapons to counter building. If you really hate building so much bring it back and nerf the player damage and make it easier to shoot down. Now you have another weapon in the game designed to counter building. 

Bounce pads are a very good example of something you've added that does this perfectly well. We now have so many new things we can do with the bounce pad that we previously couldn't do. Same with shopping carts. 

Super long post, but this is something I feel very strongly about. I really do not want to see this game die because of bad decisions by the dev team. 

**TL;DR** Stop nerfing the current meta. BUFF other strategies instead of nerfing the current one. No matter what you do to the current meta it will never go away as long as other strategies are not viable.

"Well, saying we're ""supposed"" to have build fights is a bit of a stretch. If you mean Epic intended for build fights to happen when they designed the game, you're actually wrong. That said, it has become an important part of how the community plays the game."
HiRez will manage to fuck it up like they've fucked up every other copycat title they make.
"And to the people who say ""I hate having to build five stories up just to get double pumped"", JUMP DOWN AND BREAK THE STRUCTURE. Seriously, it works a lot more than people think."
"5k games played if you include LTMs. Really getting tired of these shitty changes. Ever since the weapon swap delay they've been making worse and worse updates. 

Pushing everyone you see and getting into a huge build fight that takes up 1k+ mats is what makes this game so fun. That's how I want every fight to be. That's what makes this game so unique."
Fuck shotguns now. The pump is useless.  Any other gun will melt you before you get that second shot off.  Double shottying is basically required now.
This sub has lately been very toxic and over the top with complaints and suggestions. I remember when this sub used to be about discussion and critique about the state of the game and thoughtful suggestions on what the game needed. Now it seems like it is just recolor suggestions and epic is dumb posts. 
"Tbh every time I've heard someone say they don't like the building, they tend to be the person in the group who's terrible at videogames in general. 

They're always the people who never even *try* to build, and if you're down will just try to immediately pick you up instead of building a box around you. Those types of people make no effort to learn the game at all and won't try to learn a second time when Epic makes these changes."
Shotguns are already the most overpowered within the game. Probably cuz they’re the most used. IMO it does get old constantly being rushed and shotgunned to death. 99% of my deaths in this game are by shotguns. There needs to be a lot more weapon variety. It’s like Gears if War all over again. Gnashers EVERYWHERE
"True, but if your favorite streamer complains majority of the time about the game he plays because it’s trash then his viewers are going to stop viewing him and stop playing the game as well."
"Ive always considered the showing off a dumb thing streamers do for entertainment. You can kill most people with 100 - 300 mats but big streamers use 500 and complain about mat nerfs on a guy that has no idea how to fight.

Like double ramp is sufficient for most players, double ramp with wall is more efficient vs people that fight back but double stairs with wall with floor is such a huge waste of materials against anyone that its pointless unless you want show off that you can build really fast (and use 200 mats in 3 seconds)."
Pubg at least has gun mechanics. Imagine this game with no building and bloom 
"No. That's thinking with reason.

I want to be outraged right now!"
They should just give you 200 mats or something when you kill someone. 
"Exactly this sub is just a circle jerk karma farm now.

You legt can't give any feedback about the game thats negative in any sort of way without getting mass downvoted."
"I agree with all of this except for your sniper claim. I don't want to run around the map getting over half of my health taken away by every person that has a sniper, because they become stupidly easy to use "
"The thing is that if they wanted to make more forts fights, then they should remove the bloom and add recoil with shots that actually goes where you are shooting at. I'm not saying this out of rage, but if I have to choose between shooting someone 30-50 meters away knowing that the one with more luck will win the AR fight, then I choose to rush him and fight with the shotgun that is more consistent and not luck based. If they didn't want a shotgun meta, then they should, again, do this with smg as well, because it's really frustrating shooting someone that is almost touching you and miss lots of shots because the bloom is gigantic."
9000 games here. If epic nerfs everything even more I will suck my own dick on livestream.....in front of the White House (In snobby shores). 
"PUBG with shit gun mechanics, shit movement, and a shit map that is only playable because of building"
"i dont get it... whats unfair about others being better than u because of skill/training? people with that attitude will never succeed. and im not talking about fortnite, im talking about life."
"Streamers would *hate* competitive lobbies. Also, the turtle-fest that ends up happening in scrims already is incredibly boring to watch after you've seen it a dozen plus times."
"When mats were ""broken"" and you'd cap out at 999 at 5 kills easy, and stock back up to 999 on everything after each fight, I was always dying to get into build fights. I legit didn't care if I died in a build fight- as long as a build fight fucking happened I felt like my I got what I was aching for. I didn't care about winning, I cared about building swiftly and clawing for the highground with someone else. That shit is just pure fun."
"OW balancing is way worse than fortnite, you all got some nostalgia glasses on you..."
"I feel the exact same. If someone ramps rushes me, I often shoot out their stairs. I don't care if it's double ram double wall, because I usually will have the high ground before they do. "
"My main problem with building is that I can't do it under pressure. Give me a Radar Grid mission in STW and I can build those towers in no time. But if my mind is occupied with trying to shoot someone or more than one, I just can't build properly. I either forget I can or I do very bad panic building. The next thing I know I'm being built up on and I get 1 pumped for 150 dmg. This specific scenario has happened more than once.

I can fight decently don't get me wrong, I just can't handle combat building."
"Difference is, that’s all voluntary and not necessary to continue playing the game in its full spectrum (new weapons, traps, LTM’s, etc.)

Those companies force you to pay to participate. Don’t mistake those two and be so daft as to their differences. "
"I just fully abandonned PUBG and no longer play overwatch or CSGO, I'll have nowhere else to go"

"Can you add -50 health on kill, right now I think not punishing players for killig each other brings out unhealthy aggresion"
I just put butter on my knees to deal with the pain.

lots of salty pubstompers in here mad then can't slay bots as easily. get into the right thread ffs
"Please read all of this:

Why is everyone overreacting about the health on kill and such? Of course 7.40 was one of the best updates of this games history, but everyone is caring a little to much. Before 7.40 and pop up cups, didn’t we all play how we do now? With no mats and health on kill? If there is any reason that I am missing please reply, I want to know why people are literally QUITTING THE GAME because of this change! I am not hating on people that don’t like the change, but I want to know if there is a deeper meaning.

Edit: Spelling"
Wait why the fuck do some servers get more money than others? Why does 1st in  NA east get 5k dollars and 1st in Brazil get 2.6k dollars?
I should have 26 rn and I’m at 23.... on the brink of qualifying most likely. Gonna suck if I don’t get it cause of that 
"No one cares. Revert the update it’s not fun anymore,  and it’s sad "
This 100% happened to me in the last competitive public event I joined. Very frustrating when you have a streak going on. I immediately reported him. That was my first report in my entire 3 seasons. I assumed I got outplayed or third parties in EVERY single other death i have had.
"Ran into it on myself, saw two ballers and figured they were feeling each other out, I got close to them and they both started shooting at me and when I died just jumped back in their ballers and continued driving together"
"you don't speak for everyone lol 

Imagine a world where you get downvoted for telling someone their opinion isn’t universal. You people truly are stupid and epic couldn’t have been more right. "
People to quit complaining about pubs and  play arena? 
"> stop forcing console to play against PC.


Epic are terrified of increasing the queue times, so I doubt that will change.  "
"the whole problem in this game is the fucking rng, if they fix this issue there will be less agressive and more strategy gameplay, tryhard will be more becarefull when they rush like a fucking idiot. the only strategy in this game is rush, one pump or get one pumped, repeat."
No kidding. There are places for feedback. Being annoying doesn't do anything. 
"Keep speaking up. A lot of toxicity recently from the top players that won’t move to arena for competitive play. Pubs is for us casuals who get a 1kdr and don’t want to fight pros every engagement. 

"
"It made pubs boring and harder for players like me. I'm an average player. I can drop 10 bombs on good days and go on losing streaks on bad ones. I dont like going into a fight not knowing whether or not I'll get 3rd parties and die not due to skill, but due to other players shooting me from afar. It's not fun. But, if you kill your opponent and get 3rd partied, you'll at least have some health in order to escape, or survive the encounter.

Overall even for bots, health for kills was a great addition to the game."

"Holy shit thank you. Every single time its japan lobbies and i just realize how much more epic is screwing us over. Im a xbox player, so I have to face japanese pc with 100 ping. RIP"
"Even my bot friends and I hate that siphon rules were reverted. The game is so slow now. We farm for 10 minutes now just to get ran through instead of 5. And if we beat them, we don't have enough heals or mats to go around."
"Yes we did and the sub was swamped with pissed-off players. People were also quitting before the 7.4 update.  The update made the game actually good again and gave some hope for the futute. 

After playing the Arena for 2 days, my points are already too high to find games quickly and it only gets worse if you watch some streamers. "
"I can understand that people like it better because they all want to pop off and get 20 kills, but everyone is acting like the game is unplayable when it was like that for a year and a half lol. And the main thing that sucked before the change were the planes, turrets, zombies, etc. Also there were a million posts complaining about thirsting in the last month which was directly because of health on kill. "
Lmao. They think streamer mode will stop reporting. Probably a bunch of 8 year olds who think “if we team we can get money for v bucks”
"I understand the hatred tho, and I agree. It’s all I’ve come to expect for the past couple of days. Prepare for the incoming hatred if fixes for those aren’t in tomorrow’s patch."
"Imagine trying to act morally superior and then saying, ""You people truly are stupid""."
Was gonna ignore your comment until i saw you called people who downvote you truly stupid
"? People always complained about the lack of shield before siphon, it was the most heated topic at the time"
That’s why I just remember I don’t give a crap about upvotes from strangers and will say what I want on here. I get a lot of hate mail for being a casual and asking for gametypes for us to have fun in 
The events tab was wrong for the blackheart cup in Central Time. It said it started at 2pm in the in game events tab and it really started at 3pm. That’s why a lot of people are confused probably.
Your gonna load up to play the game anyways at some point right.? So why complain really. They do everything they can to cater to all of us with are crying about this being broke or that not being right or anything.
"It is more annoying, every single thread it's people moaning"
"I mean, Apex is still fun af. I play both games each day, because both are really enjoyable. And now that I don't teleport off my builds, I had to realise that I'm not even that trash at Fortnite anymore. And people in the arena are usually better than me, but they play the game roughly at the same pace so I have a chance to take them down (and I'm beginning to succeed more often than not).

So as soon as Epic does something really stupid, I can just go play Apex more. I don't know why they consider that game a smaller threat now, because it's still more polished than Fortnite, at least on PC."
"Arena mode is fine except consoles should be a separate pool from PC.  If they make that change, they can keep the other changes.  They also need to add Arena squad mode.

At that point, the only people who will be complaining are higher skilled players who want to rack up double digit kills against casuals and dont want the challenge of playing people at their own skill level."
Yeah if you downvoted someone saying your opinion doesn’t apply to everyone you’re fucking stupid LMFAOO 
They are truly stupid. You snowflakes apparently can’t handle a different opinion.
"good shit, it really annoys me that so many people say you can't compete on console. When these people probably have barely even tried to get to contender/champs."
"It really won't though.

1. Arena doesn't currently offer squads.
2. Arena is cross-platform lobbies.
   1. Non-comp players don't want this.
   2. Comp/prize pool PC lobbies shouldn't be the only way to enjoy siphon.
3. Pubs are objectively worse.
   1. Heals are more RNG/luck based.
   2. Fighting is basically discouraged to win.
   3. Who wants to farm THIS much in pubs?
4. Team Rumble/50v50 (when it comes around again) is worse off.
   1. People don't drop their inventory in Rumble on death, so no heals.
   2. Fighting groups of people is incredibly frustrating.

Unless they bring it back, bring it back nerfed a bit, or offer siphon lobbies that aren't cross-platform, this will impact how many people play their game long-term."
"They aren’t forced to play ranked. But we aren’t forced to play competitive playstyles either. You can choose and so can we. That’s how this works

This is how most video games I’ve played have worked. The competitive mode has competitive settings and the non competitive has relaxed settings

People hate that they can’t play competitively against bad competition. That is toxic way for this game to exist and is why many casual players left in recent months. Hopefully they come back now"
"I didn't say ""fortnite as it is is unfair"", I said ""if they keep making it easier it'll be unfair"". Siphon just makes the game less RNG. Killing players, by the simple fact of loot aggregation, means you'll get more health and loot. Siphon just makes sure that you'll get some health, just in case players don't drop heals. It also solves the problem of being cleaned after a fight. I personally liked siphon because it benefits team rumble more than anything. The main problem in team rumble is that you ALWAYS get cleaned because there are always more enemies, and no enemy will ever drop any heals."
Clearly not but they have not reverted and or addressed the plethora of negative feedback regarding it. 
Nothing better than fanboys dismissing everything as toxic.
"As I see it now, they've got around three acceptable paths they could take.

1. Make arena mode limited to your type of console only.

2. Revert the changes (what I personally think should happen).

3. Revert the changes BUT tone it down a bit (ex. Only 25 HP and 75 mats per Kill, 750 mat limit, and 20% increased harvesting rate."
"You know, Ill give ya the fact that downvotes don't NECESSARILY prove an argument wrong. You know what else dosen't?                             Petty insults and emojis."
Right now we are at 240 and it’s difficult but it’s so much fun and when I go to pubs it’s hell for the other console players
So you like it when you get in a battle and get third partied and instantly die cause you have no health?
"Thats the problem. They seem to think you are either a pc streamer pro who only wants to play crazy competitive all the time or some noob who doesnt want to take the game seriously. Theres a lot of players inbetween, especially on console, and they got screwed with this update. And dont down play the change, i can farm for 20 minutes and then if you fight good players you burn through a ton of mats and player you kill hardly drops any. And no, third partying is a huge issue in general in Br games, health and shield and mats on kills made them totally manageable. If you happen to run across someone, you have to fight, and then other peoplr who are trying to avoid losing health and mats go out of their way to third party. Its not fun for most and thats why people are pissed"
"Different people like different things.  If you give more paths of victory in a game to different playstyles then you are going to have more people happy and interested in the game.  Example, I don't like corn but most people do.  I don't walk around telling people they should hate corn, I just say good for you that you like it, there is going to be more for you because I don't.

There is also the fact that people have more time to dedicate to ""getting good"" than others.  The people who have the time to dedicate to getting better will see results.  They are going to do better.  Giving the chance still to players who just don't have that time or don't find that worthwhile is not going to impact your results much but them getting the occasional wins is going to keep them interested in the game.  If you make it so they don't have a chance and tell them they need to do something they don't have time to do and/or don't find fun then they will move on.  This is going to be a big part of the playerbase you are telling to just move on.

Also people are just gifted in different ways.  Some people run faster than others.  Some people think quicker than others.  Some people are smarter.  Those gifted people are still going to win a lot and get a lot of eliminations.  Making them win more and get more eliminations is going to only improve their experience slightly while drastically reducing the experience of many others more.

Have you ever heard of a game called Magic The Gathering?  There is a long time designer of that game named Mark Rosewater.  You should really look up his opinions and writings on these subjects.  He can state these things much better than me.  About how a game is much healthier if there are more ways to win and that it is healthier if you give everyone a chance to win.  The better players are still going to win the majority of time, but the more people who who have a chance to win the better."
How is it not toxic? And how does that make me a fanboy? I want the changes reverted too.
"I think the game is very fun right now.  They could maybe put back easy mats, but health per kill was never a good thing for the health of the overall playerbase.  It removed a huge aspect of what the game was.  Trying to survive, scavenging for heals, making strategic decisions based on your health and ability to re-heal after a battle.  It removed all that, and promoted an aggressive playstyle for good players, and a lay down and die give up attitude for casual players.  People weren't having fun unless they were decent at the game.  Without the health per kill, less than average players have a better chance at using their surrounds and situational awareness to their advantage to beat a player who is more skilled technically at the game.  "
honestly third partying sucks but is present in almost every multiplayer game especially battle royales 
"Well arena is like ranked with 300 pts, you don't have to be pc streamer pro to play it. The situation you described sounds like you should just play arena.

Of course I just understand that there is an issue that arena is cross platform between console and pc, but I think that's a different issue.

And just because you see a lot of people complain means that most people are complaining. Popular games have huge player bases and even if 1% complains it can seem like a lot of complains. So just don't say things like its not fun for most, just say its not fun for you, you don't know the opinion of other millions of players other than the thousands of complains you've seen.


"
"The metaphor about the corn is not really relatable.  
If you don't like corn, you shouldn't have to eat corn. 

We are in fact stuck having to eat that corn."
"That’s your opinion that health for kills was not healthy for the game. 


So you think it’s fair that if a team pushes me, we fight a bit, my team kills theirs, before we can even heal or loot our shit another team is pushing again already, we kill them too only to have yet another team roll on up. This type of shit happens regularly and it’s extremely annoying for good players to get chipped to death by bots hiding waiting to fight. Exactly how do they get better at the game by being a 3rd party hero?


At least the 50 HP returned gave me somewhat of a chance to fight 6 teams consecutively against my own choice. Now I have no interest in playing just to be laid out by Mr. 0.65 K/D cause I just clapped another sweat in a build fight and get one tap finished.."
You're making insults that don't prove you're point.
Yes obviously but in a RNG reliant game for meds it’s bullshit to fight off waves of people to win against them but die to 1 AR shot you couldn’t see coming cause of luck
"Yes but I should have a fair chance at beating them. Those 3rd partiers have the advantage though, because they have been camping and now that I have done work and actually fought people, they can swoop in and finish me. Siphon was a good solution to toxic 3rd partying because you were able to hold your ground because you had health from the team you killed"
"You can have a good strategic mind while not being the best with your building and aim.  You just need to put yourself in the right position (i.e. let your enemies fight each other, then hit them at the right moment). "
"You missed my point. Every BR game has the same ""toxic"" 3rd partying. That's the nature of BR and an artificial mechanic that favors the top players shouldn't be used to balance that out of play. "
"Exactly look at redeploy, it seems like 99% people hated it if you just look at this reddit, but it turns out to be 50/50 from a poll.

It doesn't matter how I feel, unless there is a poll with large number of  total votes, neither you nor I can make the claim about what the majority of player thinks.  So you should just stop with that ""majority players hates it"". It even makes you other arguments unauthentic because use of none existent claims. "
"At what point would I be wrong to expect NOT to lose to someone that is worse than me? Doesn’t really sound very entitled, sounds standard.

Then again based on your comment history that you think “build fighting is stupid” doesn’t sound like you have a huge grasp of the “build your own cover” game, lol.


Notice the part where you glazed over my question, how are you legends going to actually get better at the game being 3rd party heroes? "
"You have a higher win cause you camp no one cares about that shit, you’re trash.

With a higher win percentage you should then have a higher k/d since wins don’t count as deaths "
"Yes, except Fortnite is a different battle royale game that stopped toxic third partying by making about more who is better in combat over who just attacks a low health guy"
"But the polls arent anywhere near 50/50 and they are everywhere thats my point. Theres no support for this being some 50/50 split. This is no different than the sword or damage through builds. Do some people like it? Sure. Does the overwhelming majority? Absolutely not. Ive been there, and it sucks to be in the minority on something, but i dont think its fair to  pretends its closer than it is because of your personal feelings. Id have no problem admitting a division in the community if one existed in any significant amount on this.

Also, if a lot of people didnt like health and shield on kills, why didnt a bunch of people vocalize that ANYWHERE when the change first happened?"
you could do that with health on kills because everytime you got a kill you could get a health and make a comeback. now its just 1 hp and get third partied and then ragequit bc the game sucks rn
">but i dont think its fair to pretends its closer than it is because of your personal feelings.


Lol, why do you keep insisting I have some personal feelings about this, I don't really care at all. I spend like 2 hours every week to complete my weekly challenges in team rumble(I don't even stay since they changed that your challenge progression keeps when you leave) then I pretty much don't have time to play any other mode anymore.

There is really no point in arguing, only time will tell what Epic decides to do with the game."
"Day 2 of my character looking like they're in a back brace and drunkenly stumbling through goo lagoon.
It's just fugly to look at, the slowdown is just the cherry on top!
Thanks I hate it."
"Feels floaty while sprinting, feels sluggish when not sprinting. The new vaulting over obstacles and windows works inconsistently. Overall movement feels worse, fights feel worse. It's not an issue of getting used to it, one can get used to anything given enough time, it's about not leaving the game worse than you found it."
"Crouch walk changes fucking suck, there's nothing """"""stealthier"""""" about it. It's probably the worst movement decision they made, it's completely useless now."
"This is an utterly terrible change all around. Looks worse, feels worse, fucks with the gameplay. Have to wonder WHY they felt the need to change something that was perfectly fine already. It's not like anyone had any complaints about the movement in this game..."
I have been playing and the new animations are awful idc what they ‘got used to.’ The old ones were so smooth. The movement speed is whatever to me honestly but fix the animations. My character’s hands don’t even line up with the wall when doing parkour anymore. The older ones were slower and more controlled these are almost like a seizure of uncontrolled movement. And if you want people to have time to make strategic moves maybe so many of the new guns shouldn’t one shot the opponent with a lazer before they even know there is someone there lol. Also the Locker dear God please put it back to the way it was.
"Guns and attachments suck, new storm sucks, map is bland, and movement is nauseating."
It feels really clunky though and it’s really terrible in builds
"I hate when companies do this, talk like the robot you are and stop pretending to be my friend."
"So they acknowledge that a lot of people hate the new movement speeds and then… don’t change it? Weird hill to die on ig, just raise the speed like 10-20%"
"I don't understand why any developer would change the ""game play"". Epic just brought back OG and got lots of players back playing again. I've been playing since season 2 and the speed and mechanics have never really changed. I like the changes they make to the map and the different weapons etc. I remember when they slowed building down and everyone complained. You'd think they would have learned from that. The adage, don't fix something that aint broke comes to mind.

Anecdotally, my son and his buddies (highschoolers) have consistently played but they got seriously back into Fortnite again for OG. Yesterday he and his buds literally played an hour (they're all Champion and Unreal level players) and quit. He said they have no interest in playing unless it gets fixed.  Frankly, I'm not aware of anyone ever asking for the gameplay to be changed. Fortnite is a high skill game and timing is everything. If you don't want to play the high skill level then play Zero build or whatever the other iterations are. I guess we'll see what Epic does, but right now, I'm off Fortnite."
"You guys fuckin nailed bringing people back with OG and the lead up to chapter 5 with the event, etc had so many eyes on this game and now you all fucked it up with the absolute brain dead decision to ruin character movement. Now look what all the discussion is surrounding your game. It’s a disaster. It’s bad and you should feel bad. 

No amount of time is going to get me to “get used to it”. I played this game because I enjoyed the feel of it. A game feeling like shit to play is just gonna make me stop playing."
I am about to quit this game. Movement is so incredibly bad compared to before that this game is now unplayable for me. I just do not understand at all why this was changed. It is not about the speed but because of the weird physics my character is moving in all directions like it is drunk.
"Not playing till you fix this. 

You just brought back millions of players with Fortnite OG and you pull this crap? did you not learn anything? This game now feels completely different."
"I know people like to meme about how Epic ruins the game every major update but holy shit they actually ruined it this time.

The movement is fucking horrendous and making pretty much every weapon ADS like some dumb fucking warzone clone is ridiculous."
"This is stupid.

We all grinded HOURS to get good at building and build muscle memory.

And you try to fuck us up with shitty slow gameplay and only spam meta with no pump ?

If people want to spam and slow move there is call of duty / warzone / battlefield.

Core of the game is build + edit + pump and good angles, flicks and stuff.

And ho my god from 200 fps OG to 90 fps now ?

What a damn joke.

All those NPC and stuff all arround the map.

No mobility and only play against the zone endgame ?

So boring."
pls change moevement back its terrible yall made a bad change like when you disabled fast building its not to late to remove it
"The issue I found after playing about 10-15 matches isn't really the movement. But the weapons themselves. The TTK got drastically decreased due to these new weapons just shitting bullets out like there is no tomorrow. Hence, why the movement feels slow and out in the open, you are more or less a sitting duck, more so than before."
"I'll preface by saying I only play ZB.

Need to manage stamina better, use mobility to move larger distances, and sprint only when needed. Much more tactical all around. Sprinting everywhere could always get you into trouble, it's a VERY bad idea now. I don't mind that so much personally.

Mobility items seem plentiful from my experience, grapple blade has unlimited uses too.

I can totally see how it would completely mess up builders though. 

I assume some people are having to relearn how to build from scratch essentially. That must be very rough to experience, and I can sympathize with how terrible it must feel."
Bring back OG as a permanent playlist with legacy movement. This season is awful.
the whole flow has been ruined. it doesn't even feel satisfying to play
"The doubling down on a bad change just makes me feel really sad. The game feels worse, plays worse. This season could have been great but instead it's ruined."
"Dog shit season and chapter. Again. Movement is embarrassingly bad. After all the layoffs, Donald mustard quitting and the failed live event how can anyone still trust this company?? Sinking ship"
"Unless I missed it, I noticed while they addressed the movement issues for people, they never mentioned the UI / locker changes. Hoping they say something about it because that's one of the main things they changed I thought was bad."
"The new movement makes me feel laggy, like my controller doesn’t respond to what I want to do, I’ve been stupidly dying cause I can’t respond as quickly to attacks as I used to with the previous animation."
"New movement is trash, they just ruined the game. Great job Epic!"
"I fucking hate how the Twitter page talks now

Who the hell capitalizes tbh"
"This movement update is absolutely horrible, I hate it so much, I feel like the movement before felt unique to Fortnite. And I enjoyed it, I really don’t think there was ever any cases of out mass outcry from the community asking for the movement to be improved, I just can’t wrap my mind around what prompted this totally unneeded change. I really hope you consider reverting this movement change. It just feels so slow and clunky, but most of all it doesn’t feel like fortnite. Please please revert the movement update, at least in the build modes. I really want to be able to have some shred of what made this game enjoyable to me left."
"Let’s talk movement

We’ve moved the locker tab into the trash! Everything that was simple and intuitive? Gone!"
"Can’t wait for them to address the accounts shitting the bed thing on consoles with an other quirky ass Marvel “erm, THAT just happened!” post"
"The animation changes are somewhat cool but make no sense, no one in their right mind would run sideways by consistently crossing their legs multiple times, also, the update just killed the ""crouched rush"" strat."
"this new season is actually just horrible, why does it feel like im playing airsoft? i have to aim my gun 300 feet infront of a target thats literally infront of me to be able to hit him, and the movement is horrid"
"Please for th elove of god, revert the changes! Ive been trying my best to get used to this shit, but i just get motion sickness from the wobbely camerashakes and its so slow and clunky, its not to late to revert epic, please, this is the worst ""qualety of life"" update ever."
I really don't care about the new animations. I just don't get why they made movement in their fast paced game way slower
"I hope this is an April fool's update. 

How could you RUIN SO MUCH a game? It's like you are trying hard to do so?

When the OG came back, did you notice how much the player count spiked?

Now we have this Unity webplayer ass game lol"
"please make the storm circle move slower, and also can you tone down the NPCs? i never land in at least 5 of the 11 new POIS because not only do they all look the same but the buildings are filled with those dumb guards"
"Lol, the attitude difference between Reddit and Twitter

Reddit: WE HATE IT CHANGE IT BACK

Twitter: This is fine. Just got to adapt."
"khm... so that the devolvers in the back can hear it too: IMPLEMENT MOUNTAIN SLOPE CLIMBING! IT'S CRIMINAL THAT A WHOLE FUCKING CHAPTER HAS GONE BY WITHOUT THIS FEATURE EVER BECOMING A THING! IT'S SO CRINGE TRYING TO PLAY FINAL ZONES IN THE MOUNTAINS BECAUSE THE ONLY ITEM THAT CAN HELP IS RARER THAN SNIPERS WERE IN SEASON OG

FIX THE GAME, HOLY FUCK"
"FUCK the new storm.   There is no gameplay, all you do is run from the storm.  It fucking sucks."
"Ridiculous. The movement changes were completely uncalled for. They fucked everyones muscle memory. To add insult to injury, you cannot practice properly on these new changes to build new muscle memory because they are not playable in creative. People put years into building up a complex skill and you guys just shat on it."
"A while back we asked to nerf shotguns... so they buffed shotguns and make a new OP one.

A while back we asked to have loadout sets... so they broke them in this update for no reason.

A while back we asked to have a toggle to restrict matchmaking to PC/Console... so they took it out of the game and called us biggots and made aimbot even more OP for consoles.

A while back we asked for improvements in vaulting... so they made obstacle climbing more inconsistent and lose all the momentum.

&#x200B;

I'm starting to think that we should not ask anything, since Epic seems to do the exact opposite of what the players want. Thanks for keeping zero build mode online at least, since I feel like they could have realistically removed it, since they were so reluctant to add it in the first place. But realistically, the crap is unplayable now and no issue we had with last season was adressed. So I think Ima hop games. See ya, folks."
"Ok.. great that they are addressing this but I would argue that the locker UI update is much worse.

So can we all just chill about this movement and work together to get this locker update reverted?"
Wanting change is fine but some of you guys are threatening the devs and you gotta stop
"reading the comments here is the most cringe thing I have ever witnessed.

A bunch of 14 year olds talking about how mad they are over good changes and acting as if epic is reading them going 'yeah, I think this 14 year old with no experience other than playing the game as a consumer has a really valid point on how we have run the game. lets revert all the updates because this person said the camera angle gives him a headache'

&#x200B;

get off the internet for 1 day and just refresh yourselves, wasting your time much like I am right now. 

Its so embarrassing being the same species as some of you."
"I know I’m in the minority and will get downvoted into oblivion for saying it but I’ve always enjoyed Fortnite most when it was more about positioning and being tactical instead of flying around the lobby at 100mph trying to drop double digit kill games.

The new season is fun and the movement speed changes don’t bother me in the least."
“it’s the same speed as before. you just hate change 🤷‍♂️”
"I hope this is an April fool's update. 

How could you RUIN SO MUCH a game? It's like you are trying hard to do so?

Now we have this Unity webplayer ass game lol"
"I don't mind the new movement.  People are crazy adaptable.  New strategies will spring up quick, and in the meantime, newbies have a chance to enjoy the game without getting absolutely dunked on quite as bad as usual.  Give it a chance."
"The movement is awesome and much closer to OG fortnite, complainers are spaztics that should just play COD."
"A lot of complainers are just regurgitating whatever their favorite eceleb says, I'm glad the movement changes are here to stay, took me a few hours to get used to it and I honestly don't want to go back, ever."
"The movement is fine, but the locker has been completely ruined. All my presets are messed up. Who thought that was a good idea?"
"The nemesis AR sucks, i feel like i need to lead shots at close range, which is just foul for a assault rifle."
Really? I also play on controller but don't find it that bad.
Seriously... I've heard people complain about almost everything about this game over the years. I have not once heard anyone complain about character movement.
Looks worse? Delusional. Just need a speed in between walking and sprinting and speed up the crouch walk that’s it.
If the world revolved around what the internet yelled for we'd all be dead.
"Please help keep up the pressure on this. I hate this change too, mostly the crouch speed change. We need to repost this on the subreddit when this sticky post goes away and keep it up on the official Discord."
"its not for a reason, its playable and different you guys are complaining just because its different. Legit stop crying and get use to it"
"Lol it’s not a meme. This is why I left after Chapter 1. Came back for OG and bam now its awful again. Medallions, NPCs, excessive movement and heals, swimming and parkour. It all over complicated a simple game that didn’t need those additions and suffered from them."
I am loving the new weapons this season.  I hated them at first but it ok me about 20 games and now they are so much better than those shitty OG weapons that you could be standing 10 feet from someone and miss most of your shots.
But even for zero build the walking is so slow if you run out of stamina your dead
"I hadn't considered the players that aren't doing Zero Build tbh, maybe a lot of the people I'm arguing with are having a whole separate experience"
"It is our job to keep up the pressure. Once this tweet isn't posted, we will have to post it again on this subreddit. I'm also trying to keep it up on the official Discord."
"I read this tweet as they aren’t 100% doubling down, they are asking for people to try it for more than 24 hours of uptime.

If people are still leaving negative crazy feedback in a week, they will probably do something

Everyone is so quick to assume that this change will be permanent forever and that Fortnite is ruined after 24 hours"
i don't know why they are trying so hard to please the bad players / no build players but the game feels and flows like shit now
"Nah, movement sucks for Zero Build as well. For a mode that tends to play fast and extremly mobile, it’s like being given a pair of concrete sneakers. It’s abysmal. I tapped out of the game after 10 mins of my first match because it was so bad. Not playing again until the fix it. I’ll complete the BP by afk’ing the whole thing if I have to."
"I'm just you like where it took me years to get to a ""not great"" level of being able to build and edit, but I enjoyed being able to go on this journey acquiring this unique skill. It's the casuals like us who will get left behind. 

I'm going to check with some lower level builders to see how they find building with these awful changes.

Also, I've been saying this in my Fortnite group for so long, but they keep buying the Crew Pack EVERY MONTH! Yet they all complain just as much and more than I do."
"This!

I have no comments on movement changes. Haven't played that long, so don't have the same muscle memory that long time players do.

But the locker... What in God's name have they done???!"
"I think this is the problem - it's fucked everyone's muscle memory.

I've only played ZB and I barely noticed the difference."
"Thing is, it doesn’t just handicap Builds, but Zero Build as well. Movement is everything to Zero Build because it’s all we got, and this just feels so kludgy and wrong it’s painful. I hven’t even tried Builds yet because I dipped out of my first ZB game 10 mins in it was so maddening."

"Because it nerfs build building strategies, which is the core mechanic of the game. They nerfed turbo building a long time ago, a huge percentage of people hated it, and it got reverted. This is similar."
"wtf closer to og fortnite lmfao u must be a paid acter.

in og fn u could unbind the run button an turn on auto run so u are always running this in game is a walk"
"jesus i haven't played the game seriously since around early 2020 and it really has been so long, they stopped doing them in chapter 2 right?"
"I can see why Epic got rid of them, but I honestly think they should’ve just released patch notes a day after the release of the update, so crybaby streamers and their yesmen fanbase don’t get to knock the update without giving it a chance.

Removing patch notes wasn’t a good idea either."
"These ""update release notes"" are fucking garbage they don't mention actual numbers just words"
"no, thats just for movement. I love the movement. but everyone hates the UI"
This is what we need to be fighting for! I can get used to the movement barley noticed a difference initially. The locker UI will ALWAYS frustrate me.
"They slowed both the animation and movement speed in Battle Royale. However, they kept the movement speed in other game modes, which is why you ""slide"". Epic did all that intentionally and it is our job to keep the pressure on them to fix it."
"You had an option to crouch slower before for complete silence (it was a toggle). Now you must be extremely slow and completely silent, or jogging and noisy. It sucks."
"I don't personally think the storm needs to be super threatening.

Ask, what is the storm's purpose? It's to force players into a confrontation. It's to make sure people have to fight so people don't camp for hours in a tower or something.

It doesn't need to be hard to avoid to accomplish those goals. Even if you can outrun it, it's still forcing you into a smaller space. Punishing players for not rotating early with extra damage isn't necessary, as the people who rotate early are already rewarded by first shot at looting the new areas, as well as getting to strategic places (such as being able to gatekeep those who are rotating still, forcing them to take storm damage)."
">Stealthier just means it won't show up on audio visualizer

It already did that, but now it's useless as a counter to the visual audio ring because you barely move. They will already be at the next POI by the time you sneak to their previous location. It's completely unusable for its intended purpose in its current state."
It absolutely does look worse. Upper body is stiff while the lower body moves around. It looks weird.
Stiffer animations and slower speed is better and feels more fun? Your mind would have to be open quite some ways to think that.....
"It ruins a lot of build fight moves and there is no alternative. Has nothing to do with not liking change, I've adapted for 4 chapters."
It is if it’s a fucking dumbass change that wasn’t necessary at all. It also makes people sick just trying to play the game.
">""We made the game less fun, but focus groups and leadership **know** that it's more fun, so fuck off.""

Alternatively they can just lie and say

>""We have found that a small percentage of players do not like X issue. The majority of feedback has been positive so we're keeping it, so fuck off."""
"I doubt it’s an intern. Social Media Management is a big deal in 2023, no company is leaving it to some rando"
"43% nerf to crouching speed is different, yes. It also ridiculously slow, sucks and I will complain about it."
"literally everyone has been upset about it, and its for a reason. i dont care if its ""playable"" its weird as hell. if something is worse off we shouldn't have to take it. i already said i got used to it, its legit still ass."
"I play almost exclusively zero-build, and it sucks. Not sure why this would be more beneficial to zero-build, there's more of an argument that the riot shield needs nerfing there."
It’s literally less than 10% slower. It’s weird to get used to but it’s not like it makes enough of a difference to guarantee your death lol
Let's do our part then and keep up the pressure. The movement changes still suck.
"Tried it, it's like they took things from apex and cod and slapped it into Fortnite... Hot garbage... I canceled 5 crew memberships and am switching to apex, movement is awesome, fluid, not clunky and slow."
I’m not really sure why you’re attributing this change to no build when it feels equally as terrible there
holy. that is going to really mess up your rhythm if you use those a lot
Can't be said enough that blue checkmarks are almost all certified trolls or morons thanks to Elon's stupidity.
"No it just broke a lot of build fight techniques, you probably play zero build so it doesn't affect you."
It broke building. Zero build it might be fine building is completely fucked with it.
There is some weird replies on here from paid or possibly employee accounts. Damage control maybe
"Kinda like you can toggle a walk speed instead of jogging. I think on PC it is the comma key by default? You have to check your keybinds. Also, you can ""aim down sights"" to move slower and more silently. Now you just always inch along silently, which sucks. The whole ""you have a more stealthy crouch"" is bullshit."
"Like, just make a game that has some consistency rather than tweaking every update. I swear, for like 3 chapters, I could feel small changes in the mechanics every update. Why couldn't they just make a game and then build on that? Why make the community guinea pigs? It really is a terrible business model. They parade around as inclusive, but they exclude a lot of people who don't want to adapt to their dumb tweaks every 2 weeks.

If we don't get better options for heals and mobility early this season, I am done."
"He was talking about “flicking”, building, editing… all that seems like X,Y axis adjustable. But maybe I’m wrong"
It’s crazy that you’d rather people talk in a cold unfeeling way and actually get UPSET when they show emotion. That’s a really bleak worldview.
Im a zero build player and lemme tell you we all hate it too
"That’s the thing, I’m sure the game itself is quite fun. I don’t really have any issues with what I seen about the chapter so far, but the movement is so unnerving and frustrating, that I just can’t get past it to be able to get in and enjoy playing. I’ve played this game non-stop for six years now ever since C1S2 and never had a change that stopped me from wanting to play, so this is a first. It’s that bad."
">Hell I'm middle aged and it took one game to get used to everything. I can't get the hate

It fundamentally changes movement, and building and editing because of it. If you're not experienced with building or have played the game very much, you may have just answered yourself."
"Certain building moves no longer work, and there are no replacements. It might be fine for zero build players, but builds are transformed for the worse."
I don't play build so I had no idea. What's wrong with it in build mode?
"> Just make a game that has some consistency rather than tweaking every update

> Why couldn't they just make a game and then build on that?

Pick one. 

> They parade around as inclusive, but they exclude a lot of people who don't want to adapt to their dumb tweaks every 2 weeks.

What a horrendously stupid take. The inclusivity of Fortnite is for marginalized groups, and grumpy gamers are not one of those groups. 

It's a live service game, the nature of that is regular tweaks - some are good some are bad, but they things need to be tried and tested, thats how games evolve. 

This sub is the most dramatic clown show I've seen in a long time."
"the OG machine gun is modeled after an M249 SAW, the OG assault rifle is modeled after a SCAR, the tactical shotgun is any modernized tac shotgun, the burst assault rifle was a FAMAS, the bolt action sniper was an LWS, FPS optics have been in the game for awhile... but yeah, now, suddenly, in this chapter FN is losing it's identity and becoming a COD clone because it has some optics..."
"Comparing the representation of historically unrepresented groups to struggling to adapt to a live service game is bonkers. The sub's in total meltdown right now, never seen anything like it."
"No, it’s losing its identity because it’s needlessly overcomplicating a mechanic that people were just fine with for six whole years. You’d think they would have learned from the last time they overcomplicated weapons in C2S6 and the reaction players had to that."
"I think there's no visual audio yet when you rush, too, because i was fighting a team and the next thing i know Shield Boy had smacked me in the side with a rush.

i like your idea of requiring a pistol, then you have to find two items to make it work. and a fallen team mate has more difficulty handing off the shield to others when they get knocked.

it would just need to have basic gray pistol damage and aim regardless of rarity and modifications..."
"Good thing the changes aren't ""every two weeks"" then, huh?

Also, if adapting to new game mechanics at regular intervals is difficult for you...maybe a live service game that regularly changes isn't a good fit for you?"
"That makes sense, though whatever pistol they have in hand seems like it should be ok. 

But to balance it more I'd think that some weapons - and not specialized ones like the plunger - should be able to pierce the shield directly and do maybe reduced damage. That would make high powered ARs more attractive when dealing with shields. 

Shotgun rushes are somewhat effective now. But until they fix the movement I don't know how much I'll be playing. I love the map but there's too many little things that take away from the fun. I have a big backlog of games I can play until they fix it or next season 🤷‍♂️"
"I thought all the OG players hated this update and uninstalled fortnite :D. Glad you are enjoying it man, I'm a filthy casual who normally just plays this cause of my nephew but this is the first time Fortnite has actually captivated me and I am enjoying the gameplay/guns. I agree Storm needs to be toned down a bit but not too much I like the frantic pace of it all rather than it being at times 10minutes of running around doing nothing last season"
"Ahh my bad, I have brainrot and legit didn't see the sarcasm without the /s"
"Save it. I’ve been playing this game non-stop ever since C1S2 and I’ve played through nearly every change they’ve ever made. I think I’m perfectly qualified to have a valid opinion on what Epic’s been doing with the game recently. For the record, I don’t mind change at all, but what they’ve done with weapons is very un-Fortnite-like. They have history with weapon mods that weren’t well received at all, which is why I said you’d think they would have reconsidered the idea of mods before dumping them on the playerbase."
"my only problem is then it's hard to tell when and how to defeat the shield, if you always know they have a grey pistol you can act a certain way, but finding out it's purple with an extended mag would be extra cheesy


it's just a dumb item it needs nerfed"
Can we get an update on the constant stuttering/hitching problems a lot of people have been having? That update/fix didn't do anything for me and apparently quite a few others.
"Y'all can nerf the missiles, nerf the health, nerf the shield, nerf the harvest, nerf the movement and it might not be ""OP"" anymore but at the end of the day it is a weird, inelegant design decision that doesn't fit the core game mechanics in any way and will never be a beloved, memorable, value-adding part of the game.

Even the ballers, although problematic to many, at least *fit* the game in its ability to climb and traverse builds.  It was a sensible concept.  What does a giant clunky robot have to do with a game about building forts? Be the nemesis of all things fort-related?"
Just get it OUT of core modes. This thing is ridiculous let me choose to fight against it if I want to. Don't force me into it have you learned nothing?
"How are you going to leave this shit in the game when there’s a bug that makes it literally invisible? It’s already over powered enough. Take it out, go back to the drawing board to make it balanced, re-release it. Or just move it to Team Rumble only for now. Too many games ruined by this dumb shit. Played 2 trios today only to get wiped by mechs in both games. Shit’s a joke"
"So this is going to be the same old cycle where it repeatedly gets nerfed again and again each patch and then removed at the start of season 11. Why dont you just save us some time and just remove it. This thing doesnt belong in the game, regardless if its OP or trash after nerfs. This thing just does not belong in fortnite"
"heya epic,

maybe you should evaluate how on earth any of you guys thought that, even for a moment, that the brute was not only a good addition to the game, but also that it was ready to be added?

please take this time while the game is an absolute dumpster fire to just fix it. Theres absolutely nothing fun about this game anymore. I don't want to play if im going to open 4 chests and only get a burst smg. I'd leave a game before id attempt to even use a burst smg. I'm sick of looting a house and finding 3 silenced pistols and 2 drum shottys. It's incredibly frustrating to see that even now, in season 10, im still getting the same bug where i can't ready up, and then other times, i don't press ready up and yet i still get into a match. 

I thought season 9 was a bad season but only a few days into this one and I can't stand this game anymore."
"When the BRUTE gets nerfed or even vaulted, don't even praise them for doing so guys. Sure, they may have ""listened"", but this robot serves absolutely no purpose in a battle royale game where building is the core mechanic. It's a pattern I've noticed. Epic adds some stupidly overpowered thing, then after a few days or weeks, nerf or vault said thing and everybody praises them. I'm getting sick of this shit."
Just get rid of it? Why would you even think to add something to the game that is that obnoxious. The people who had the idea to add it into the real game should probably rethink their future updates.
"Horribly unbalanced. It can shoot missiles, fire shotgun shells, harvest mats faster than a pickaxe, jump and lunge, and loot chests without destorying its contents. It also has 1,000 hp which is very unfair in solos or smaller team modes. 

We know it was just a marketing ploy to get players hyped for this season but they are CANCER to be around"
This isn't them listening. at all. and if you think it is you're wrong.
Vault the damn thing or at least relegate it to an LTM
How about you just admit failure and defeat and vault it Epic?
"Heya folks,
 
GET IT OUT OF ARENA. I shouldn’t 200 to 0 die from a barrage of mistakes from optimus prime standing on top of dusty depot when i’m in a build fight with a different player at salty springs. 
 
ty (-:"
Fuck your stupid mech and fuck whoever thought of it
"THIS IS FORTNITE. WHY IS A MECH HERE... it just does not fit fortnite at all... in the slightest. That and the combat shotgun, that shotgun has to be where 80% of people get their kills. It’s been a season and a half of that shit already. No one uses any other shotgun epic. Cmon listen to people already. It’s the most overpowered gun ever. Takes every shotgun and smgs place. Why use an smg when that thing can deal more from the same distance and shoot so fast why are YOU GUYs so STUBBORN"
It's been over 24 hours... wtf are you monitoring?? It takes one single game to realize it has to go.... or you too busy to play one or somethin? Then just take literally everyone's word for it.
"Just thought i'd Update your status update, game is still unplayable, solo's are basically whoever has a mech at the end wins, and it's still stupid as fuck. 

this isn't mech warrior, this is a fucking battle royale, no one wants to loot up, play a game for 15-20 minutes, to die to something that can barely be countered. 99.9% of the time, you just explode, through walls, buildings, trees, oceans, planets, and universes you just explode. IT'S FUCKING STUPID.

&#x200B;

and if you could do me a great favor, and pass it on to the brain dead fuckwad whose idea it was, please kindly tell them to go fuck his/herself."
"Please nerf them hard or just remove them completely, 2 games in a row me and my friend got second place but died to teams in brutes and in one of the games a team had 2 of them, there's no good defence or offence against them and they just ruin the flow of the game."
"I hate them in Team Rumble too... it is easier to kill them, but my controller is vibrating for 75% of the match... so annoying"
"Ive never been one to call for something to be vaulted. My theory has been 'just adapt'. But that's different with then B.R.U.T.E. the whole family played Fortnite. My Niece is a teen, she is the super sweaty builder who can drop 15 kill games and get VRs easy when she concentrates. My nephew is a typical 8 year old who does the dances and he's toxic. I'm the casaul, I can get a about a win a week, but my building skills are pretty trash. I also have a compulsion to complete every challenge. My father is the ultimate bot. His highest kill game is 3. He can't build at all, he struggles in fire fights. He gets a Win about once a season out of dumb luck. He also loves the game more than anyone at our place. Usually we all fight over the controller and who gets to play.  That has died out this week. No one wants to play. We all hate the B.R.U.T.E. even the trash players out of us hate the thing. It pissed me off having uncleared challenges hanging about, but I don't really care this season. I don't give a damn about the B.R.U.T.E challenges. I'd gladly let their  hang their uncompleted just to have a decent game again."
"You guys have disabled many things that were bugged, remember when shadow bombs released and they were taken out because of bugs? What make this BRUTE so damn special to you guys? 99.9% of people I’ve seen talk about hate the thing, just why Epic, just why? Between the sword, ballers, planes this thing is WAY worse than all of them combined, seriously what is the thought process here?"
If you don’t take it out the health has to drop to no more than 300. 1000 is RIDICULOUS
"No evaluating, just vaulting, please, I just died to another brute in a solo game it’s actually horrible, get them out now"
"I chose not to renew my pass this season due to the battle pass structure changes, and the ridiculous BRUTE power.

I doubt Epic will see this, but they lost my business because of it 🤷"
"The B.r.u.t.e makes the game extremely not fun to play, my friends and I want to play but we die to them every single game :("
It's been a week. Remove it! Don't you guys see how stupid this is?
"Stuff like the new tilted is great, unique weapons with unique gameplay, but this thing is just disgusting and should have been removed last week."
Just get rid of the MECHS. They completely ruin the game for everybody who cannot get their hands on this over-powered crap.
Fucking idiots couldn't bother to think that people would team up in solo with them. Unbelievable how lazy Epic is at this shit. And it so frustrating not being able to do anything about it
Just get rid of it. It's the worst item ever added to this game and the fact that y'all even thought it worked here just kinda shows how out of touch you are with your base.
"Just get rid of it and fire the man who came up with the idea, it’s stupid and you know it’s stupid, We have all wisened up to your ridiculous marketing strategies and so if you want this game to continue being successful you need to cut the shit because dear god man I think I speak for the overwhelming majority when I say we are at our wits’ end"
"I have no desire to touch the brute. If I see one near I will go self destruct it so no one can use it. I hate fighting it. Especially when you are able to outplay one brute and kill it but guess what there’s ANOTHER ONE THAT THE SAME TEAM HAS HOW IS THAT EVEN A THING. 

If there was a LTM with brutes more centered around then I would be interested in playing it to have fun with them. Shit put in planes too and let us have a huge ass battle with them. But in a separate mode for the love of god."
You guys are such a bad company. How can you be so out of touch with your fucking community. It sickens me
We have come to the conclusion that the driver should also be able to fire weapons and B.R.U.T.E can take massive ping damage across map while trying to engage in battle so we will be adding armor replenish for each elimination you get while in B.R.U.T.E
"Not sure why you guys put this in Arena right away. It’s so obviously overpowered and now very low skilled players can unfairly get a lot of hype. Also, why can’t you derank in Arena?? Arena will never be a true ranked mode because of this"
Are you all even going to mention to the thousands of us pc players that can't even play the game bcause the horrible FPS drops? I have a nvidia geforce 2030 graphics card and can run fortnite on 240fps. Ever since season 10 came out I cant even get into fights without it dropping to 20-30fps. It's unplayable. My character just freezes and when I come back after a second I'm dead. How can this not even be addressed as an issues you are working to resolve?
"""Siphon promotes unhealthy aggression."" 

""Adds in 1000 hp + shield, 10 rocket shooting, shotgun having, stomp farming & killing mech."" 

GGs only?"
What is there to monitor? It is universally hated. Get it out of the game and let us play the game like normal
"At first they weren't so bad to deal with. Shoot them down and they explode... But then people started getting better with their movement and getting right up on you...

I think the moment I realized they needed to be nerfed, was when I was trying to get away from one, and built TWO FULL layers of wall ramp floor(roof) and cone in front of me.(TWO FULL LAYERS...) and the brute shot its missiles at me and it almost instantly broke through both of those layers, as well as any builds I was turbo building, and then killed me before I could even blink.

There is no skill involved in holding Left click until 10 and then letting go. It's just too OP.

I like the idea of Mechs so I just think they need a nerf, that's all. Nothing crazy. Maybe limited ammo, or less explosive damage. I'm not sure, but something has to happen!"
"Please address the health, shield, and damage along with just movement exploits."
"just take it the fuck out. it completely ruins the flow of the game and just takes away the fun. season x would be so great right now, with the fun chaos of tilted town and the great bp and honestly perfect skins imo, but you had to fucking ruin it by adding a huge 1000 hp robot suit that shoots 50 damage missiles that can one shot people even through builds? bull fucking shit. idek what epic is thinking at this point"
"At least you guys finally acknowledge it but the Brutes makes all modes boring as hell, i cannot stand playing squads, duos, and solos I make it a mission to self destruct these stupid fucking brutes."
"It has no place in normal gamemodes, just keep it in team rumble and/or make a separate ltm for, problem solved!"
"Ok, I appreciate that you finally said *something* on the matter. However, isn't it clear that it needs a nerf? The missiles often kill instantly without a chance for counterplay."
"""We aRE eValUAtING tHE BrUTe RobOT""
You knew damn well it was over powered.  You play tested it.  You should know,  stop making your game shitty so the media will talk about your game.  Make it good CONSTANTLY DO BUG FIXES AND KEEO TO DATE WITH STUFF. This is pathetic every update you do it breaks the game.  You are terrible game devs"
"You’ve had five days to evaluate it. The damn rockets are OP as fuck. Enough said, nerf it please."
"fix the fucking stuttering already... im on a $2000 pc and its unplayable for me, not even going to talk about the retarded mech and no building town :S"
OP missile launcher aside..Still lost as to how you guys thought 1000 health was balanced when the baller had to be nerfed from 500 to 150 and it didnt even have any type of weaponry on it.... just saying
"u/JustMooney1 This is a great thing BUT why hasn't hitching and FPS drop been properly and thoroughly addressed? Game stability is at an all time low and make the feel clunky and gross  
The community is constantly providing feedback on this issue, including large streamers and content creators - so it's not unknown to you that this is causing your game to be a woeful experience.  
Lay off the content updates, give us something worthwhile. Unfortunately it looks like it'll be a whole week to the next patch before you get your S\*\*t together."
Can the developers fix the building in titled town exploit or will that be another feature along with everything else wrong with the game.
Get rid of brutes.. period. This season ****ing sucks ass because of them. Literally unplayable.
Has anyone died to an invisible BRUTE? Because for some reason I died to it but could not see it like wtf
"I'd like a counter for Brutes and incoming vehicles with E.M.P (emp) grenades

it will disable any vehicles, stop shield ( damage taken will go directly to hp while the shield is down ) for a few seconds.

And disable some weapons features, like tracking for the guided missile (if it were to be reintroduced),

storm preview in storm snipe, even cut the glider on collision.."
Your dumb minds can’t “evaluate” anything. You messed up like never before.
Bring on Mech Wars.  LTM duo were everyone gets a B.R.U.T.E.
"FFS, before evaluating these things, PLEASE for the LOVE of GOD, remove the B.R.U.T.E from SOLO and ARENA SOLOS, then evaluate the thing all you like.

The amount of teaming with these things going on is absolutely batshit insane.  

People playing Arena Solos should be losing hype or gaining hype from their performance.  They should not lose hype because two people who don't care about playing fair decide to jump into a B.R.U.T.E, and kill people, yet they are.  They are losing hype because of cheating YOU are directly enabling / doing nothing about.  I've almost decided to give up trying because of all the teaming I've been both witness to, and ""victim"" of.  (All the times I've been killed by teamers, I have reported them)"
"This is such a bullshit response. You know most of us hate it, why keep it? At least take it out of arena!"
Movement related bug. Can I report that it’s still not been moved to the vault?!
Shout out to any Epic devs who are reading this thread seething in rage because they knew the robot was a bad idea but upper management forced them to add it to the game anyway
"Just get it out already, casuals hate it, average players hate it, pro players hate it HEEL ME THE BIGGEST MOTHERFUCKIN NOOB HATE IT !! FUCKIN VAULT IT"
I've quit playing and spending money on the item shop.  I'm not the only one.  That should be enough to tell you what you need to do with the mecha
"The most frustrating thing for me is that they never learn.

Just put it in a separate mode, it really isn't rocket science."
 evaluating : You are a billion dollar compagny who made terrible mistake in the past... The best exemple was the sword and every one told you it was cheated. After a pro scrim you nerf / removed it. Now you add something WORST and you think about evaluating ? You KNOW it's cheated and now the entire gameplay is based on play with it or counter it. It's maibe handable in solo but in duo / trio / squad it's unplayable right now. Make pop a brut on the tiny circle who have only 4 squares IS STUPID.
I have played for 10 seasons now but now i had enough!!  all becuse the  B.R.U.T.E. waste time and farming and 10 min later a  B.R.U.T.E. comes and 1sec you are dead gg epic games !!!
TAKE OUT THE B.R.U.T.E IT IS NOT FAIR AT ALL! RUINS GAME ENTIRELY. NOT FUN AT ALL.
" Apex said Titans are OP so they will never add them, BFV added a Tank no one play that S\*\*\*t, Pubg added an APC and they nerfed it to the ground. Now Fortnite BR added a Freking Armored Titan Tank to the game and everyone gets destroyed by it and they say they are still observing W T Heck. Vault this thing."
"Bro, just get rid of it. Like 15% of the community wants it at best. Tell the decision makers there at Epic they’re going to lose their playerbase if they continue to make decisions the majority of the community hate. It may be a gradual decline, but it will happen."
"Heya Folks,

We realize the mech is broken and you all hate it, but we’re gonna leave it in while we see for ourselves because we don’t play-test new additions or even play our own game at all. Enjoy the no building POI in the meantime. Dab on the haters. 

Go fuck yourselves Epic"
"Sooo you have had a week of absolute non stop feedback from the community regarding the mechs and now you will merely keep us updated?
Please stop taking the piss"
Is anyone else having invisible people attack them?
"> Firing each missile costs 10 materials; missile damage is halved; can no longer collect materials by breaking objects

Seriously, this is such an easy fix for brutes. At the very least, rocket launcher changes are needed to limit them in both early- and late-game"
"Firstly make them not appear in solos, same with arena. Make them have less health, and then also make the rockets either: take more time to recharge or make them fire less rockets or make the rockets do less damage and do less damage to structures. Limit the amount from like four to 2 in each match"
"Hi guys, we have seen your complaining and upset with the brute, we dont really care and want to leave it in the game for as long as possible so please hold off while we reassess wtf we are going to do for the rest of the season as the majority of the missions and story revolve around brute and we never ever dreamed of it being an issue as we are so out of touch with our own game. 
Thanks."
"If this is how things are gonna be from now on (op robots, no building area). I hope this game dies, cause those idiots are digging it’s grave."
"VAULT THE FUCKING THING, OR MAKE IT AN LTM, AT THE VERY LEAST REMOVE IT FROM FUCKING ARENA WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS"
My game has been crashing constantly on my gaming PC but my Surface Pro 2 hasn't crashed once. I don't know if it's just a problem that I am having or whether other's are also experiencing it so I hope you don't mind if I hijack your comment to ask others if they are having this problem too
"same... on a good/great pc here (i7-9700k, 2x8gb ddr3200mhz ram, rtx 2060, ssd disk) and season x ruined fortnite completely for me, it was great at the end of season 9 no stutters at ALL, but now drops from 240 stable fps to under 100 constantly with half a second hitches/screen freezes, got me killed countless times already in build fights or any fight really, just mind numbing at this point so stopped playing altogether, rip"
It's probably considerably lower considering there's a very limited amount per game.
"Yeah, I want to know the survive rate/percentage of people that encounter a mech and are attacked by it. Willing to bet over 90% of encounters with a mech, especially in duos or solos, end in death for the non-mech player. 

In other words, this is EASILY the absolute worst and honestly down right stupidest addition to this game in its 2 years. Worst than planes and ballers, which I didn't even mind. Worst than double pump. Worst than the season that was pure lag and building issues. Worst than the consistent travel anywhere meta of last season. Mechs absolutely ruin this game."
& balls had 150 HP vs 1000 and no ability to shoot back
"Absolutely on the money. It just doesn't fit.

I (we?) want shopping trolley levels of stupidity, or golf karts. This robot just doesn't fit the feel."
"They always nerf the hell out of an item that’s well hated to the point where it’s useless too.  Just remove it.  They did this with the turrets and now the only time we could use it, they vault it.  Epic is spot on with decision making🙃"
Ballers were fine after the nerfs they received. I actually quite enjoyed them (this is coming from someone who hates almost all foolish new stuff EPIC tries out.) MECHS however seem like the result of a little to much personal biochemical experimentation on the developers side
Epic is extremely stubborn. We’ve known this before with their responses to an fov slider and separate lootpools
"it just happened to me in the last game, I was stood next to it when I died. Didn't even see it on screen until I spectated it. 

&#x200B;

And my first match of the day, one spawned in Tilted. It was a massacre"
P90 on release oh my God don't remind me. I hated the double pump since I had just started playing at the end of S3 but that P90 coming in at over 300 dps made me long for that again. That thing absolutely tore through entire squads
"This community needs to learn they're a tiny fucking spectacle of the community that plays this game. As much as people on this subreddit hate those things, there's always going to be a ton of kids and casuals who like this stuff."
And how about the 500 hp ballers or whatever they started at
Brute forsure should not be in the game but complaining  about getting bad weapons is pretty weak. If everyone got a gold combat right away it wouldn’t be as fun it sucks getting shitty luck but that’s just part of the game.
if you can hit your shots the burst isn’t bad in early game
It’s all part of their stupid plan. Like seriously for fuck sake why does this shit needs more evaluation it's obvious as fuck.
Because they need to make sure it’s actually worth talking about and not some first day crying shit.
"Nor, for that matter, should people be dying and losing hype due to people deciding to team up to kill others in Arena Solos.

The fact that Epic is ignoring this real problem really shakes up my trust in Epic's management of the game."
"Ya if I see a teammate in one just get in and self destruct, fuck those things."
Is this constructive criticism and feedback I'm seeing? I must be in the wrong sub.
"Yep, it’s been reported here multiple times. It’s unreal that they’re leaving it in the game as is. They either need to vault it or just remove it until they fix all the bugs and nerf it then put it in Team Rumble only. Or an LTM."
"this is happening to me too ,

I think it might happen because your memory goes too high

dont know if this helps but try making your memory usage go down.

This crash has been happening since season 7 to me by the way"
"The combat is epic’s way of giving everyone the ability to double pump since some ppl weren’t skilled enough to switch weapons i guess....hence the 10 shot capacity, the range, and the speed of the shots....everything but the damage"
"Of course, the combat kills more people than the pump. The pump sucks and the combat is king"
Totally. The golf carts were hilarious and fun. Robots don't fit at all... but still biggest issue for me is how often i get killed by the robots in solo..  i'm done until they fix
Lets add a big ass robot that shoot missles that do 50 damage each and has a shotgun on it.
"Because they add weapons without removing so most similar ones

&#x200B;

\- Why add a new revolver without vaulting deagle ?

\- Why add this new sniper without vaulting Scoped AR ?

\- Why the Drum Shotgun ???

\- Why proximity Grenade Launcher ???

&#x200B;

Those repetition made the lootpool look like a complete mess."
"It gets to a point when it feels like weapons are added just to be dogshit in any situation. When the burst smg was revealed I immediately thought it was stupid. What's the point of a close quarters weapon only being a burst? That pretty much destroys the entire purpose of it being close quarters. Couple that with it's ridiculous recoil and it becomes unusable in any situation.

The drum shotty at first at least seemed cool, but after shitting out a hellstorm of what seemed to be confetti onto my enemy, it still can't kill someone with 200 health.  Now I find it literally everywhere.

The silenced pistol is still in the game. God knows why.

The new revolver is just kind of pointless. This is like the 5th time they've tried to add a revolver and it still doesn't bring anything to the table that might make you want to pick it up over anything else. Really don't know why they brought back the old revolver too.

I've only just talked about 4 weapons and yet that seems to be like 75% of all loot in the game now. At what point does it just get old to keep finding the same 3 weapons everywhere?"
"Yeah, the weapons are luck of the draw. The giant shitty robots take luck and skill away and ruin the game."
The problem is they were praised for nerfing/vaulting literally every other ridiculous item by idiots in the community. That’s why Epic has reached BRUTE levels of stupidity. It was caused by THIS community.
I'm casual as fuck and would still prefer if every single mode didn't feel like goddamn Mech Assault right now.
We’ll also be implementing a regeneration system whenever the player is inside the B.R.U.T.E and will make the brute a 1 person vehicle to prevent players from hijacking and self destructing them
"Double pump didn't required any skill though, it was an easy way to spam damage, that's why people were enamoured with that particular glitch."
Brutes also aren’t a threat when 9+ people can melt it in seconds.
"I mean, it's another controversial item, like the Sword. A lot of top players didn't like it, because it would mean that somebody who's way worse than you could kill you very easily. That's how I feel about the mechs. It sucks being late game with like 14 kills, and just get insta-killed by a mech."
So fuck everyone early game... Where you have no ammo going against a god damn Mecha Robot... Makes sense!!
To be fair the shotgun is kinda ass but missiles are a pain in the ass
"Dude I love the combat but the double pump was god. 400+ damage to the face, I miss it so bad. 

Inventory:
1- 50 Cal
2- Blue Pump
3- Blue Pump
4- Minis
5- Assault Rifle"
"Also if you get an incompetent driver or Gunner the thing is an active hindrance to your team, since they have a tendency to shoot down all the builds they see and you can't stop them."
"Ya, they aren’t that hard to kill if you third party one that’s in a battle but if you get third partied by one or are in an open field you’re going to either burn through 1k+ mats to try and get away or you’re going to get fuckin stomped on by rockets. It’s not like you even guarantee damage against them when you destroy one. Players, if competent will literally just hop out."
"Competitive, reddit, Twitter and content creators are gonna complain about your every thing they do, unless they reintroduce siphon. Honestly, I see vids talking about the decline in views on Fortnite on Twitch and Twitter and YouTube etc and the talking heads take it as a sign people are upset about the new stuff. They won't even entertain the idea that maybe views are down because we're sick of the belly aching.  I unsubbed from ThatDenverGuy and Chaos and a few others because I got sick of the complaining, not because I got tired of Fortnite."
Once it has like 100 health or gets self destructed the pilots or pilot who didn’t initiate self destruct should be trapped in the vehicle and eat the damage...the missiles should also damage the robots shields/the robot itself and/or the people inside if the shields are gone and they are launching missiles at someone they are curb stomping
Why would you assume no one is there to kill you? It's literally the point of the game mode
"Why? 

Getting 3rd partied at one of the bosses happens every single time. The second you kill one you grab his loot immediately and haul ass."
Whoever made the quest where you HAVE to hit four players with Doom’s Gauntlets needs to be fired cuz that’s some high quality bullshit
"This is why I mostly stopped going there. Always one or 2 people camping in some hidey hole waiting for you to do all the work and then shoot you in the back when you're done.  Or they wait till you got him down close enough for them to finish. Come on people.... put in the work yourself... He's not that hard to defeat! Shoot him, jump to the balconies, reload, repeat. And I was only going there to finish the quests for his powers and finally finished it Monday.  I don't care to get his gauntlets anymore. I think the others are better anyways imo."
I can’t count how many times I was nearby and initially not going for the medallion and then chose to only to arrive right as they boss was being killed so it seemed like I had been camping as I show up and kill the person who did it. I’d imagine this happens to lots of other people too. Obviously tons of third party campers lying in wait but it’s not always the case.
unspoken rule of boss poi's is make sure everyone else is dead
50% percent of these comments can be summed up to ‘just adapt’ yeah how the fuck am I supposed to adapt when some kid thinks he’s all tough for hiding like a coward
"Yeah, it's really annoying when this happens but it always happens which is why I always wait around for anyone who wants to sneak in and take everything. Most of the time I avoid the whole thing altogether."
"What? Kill you in a battle royale? Yeah what assholes, playing the game how they’re meant to"
Guess I’m a dick.  But I’m a dick with mythics and you’re readying up
I have got a few kills like this but not camping but running to the boss after they start the boss fight
If you have doom armor thats gonna be most people's answer
That's your own fault tbh. You have builds and u can see the footsteps...
cry harder? maybe pay attention to your surroundings
"So I should just let you run away with the medallion because you don’t wanna get killed?

Grow up and play the game, you’re complaining about dying… in a battle royale game. It’s your fault for not assuming someone would be there to try and take it"
Nah ur a dick for not thinking about someone killing u
"? It’s a pvp game with 100 players in a match, and you have to be the last one standing. If you see someone out in the open looting, you’re gonna shoot them. You’d be dumb to not do what this guy did from his perspective. 

If you want to not die like this, try building a box around yourself whenever your looting for more than a second or two "
"""if you kill me in a battle royale, you're a dick! How dare you kill me? 😡"""
"This is exactly why boss specific and boss item specific quests should not exist. It just promotes toxic behavior. If they insist on repeating this stupidity, at least put in some sort of failsafe. Like the item shouldn't drop from the player unless they've had it longer than a minute or at least start penalizing people for teaming with enemies when they boss-snipe."
"Skill issue, you clearly couldve built a wall and the continue the fight but inseated you decuded to get beamed to death"
I had the opposite experience. I help another player to kill it. And he killed me afterwards. Altruism will die with our generation 😂😂
Personally I like to get Emma Frost about 3/4 and then digit to the sewer underneath waiting for her to get finished. If nothing else I usually get a kill or two off it
"Go get the gauntlets when Doom is in the storm, that's how I did the quest."
"You need his gauntlets for one of the new Doom quests...

Sorry man, you're going back to Castle Doom whether you like it or not"
The footprints were from a doom soldier and they weren't from the same direction where the bullets came from
I checked the whole damn castle and couldn't find anything
Killing another player in a battler royal game is not toxic behaviour.
The only time i let people off the hook is in ranked when we drop for the same chest and I win bc i know how much it sucks to queue for 5 minutes and then die instantly after being beat to a chest by .1 seconds
"I get that it's annoying but it's a PvP game. There are no unwritten rules to just let a player live for whatever reason. 

Being cautious of a 3rd party applies to every fight throughout the entire map, but even more so when other players can see the health bar from a distance."
"Ugh, for effs sake! Lol....I'm waiting on that one until it isn't so new. Give people time to shoot other people in the back. Every time there's location quests like those, there are always the people that hide in the shadows for people to come along. I expect them, but they are not always easy to search out when you have other players or npcs, or bosses shooting at you."
"Okay ""defeat wolverine"" was the hardest challenge we ever got in this game. But does that mean no other challenge can ever be considered as difficult???? Is that seriously your logic?"
This is way harder than search 7 chests at risky reals. I don't remember having any problems with that challenge back in season 4 and I was a new player.
"Many users confirming this is fake and there's no video footage, why do people consistently believe posts like this which have no sufficient proof."

For everyone saying it’s fake.. notice the “MEME” flair?
Been there forever. Stop flooding the damn sub with shit.
"So many people have said this is fake, but still no one has posted a video..."
I went to the crack in Lonely Lodge yesterday and couldn‘t see it (or hear the sound) at the main house while my brother was able to see it. Really weird and now this...
"Possibly, but who knows with Epic. The servers could crash again or something."
Ah yes looks like fortnite is going bankrupt just like Detroit by the looks of this
"Why are you lying and possibly making people buy a pickaxe they don't even like just because this fake shit you made?


Edit: I love seeing his comment get down  from 240  to 108, keep it going...and report him to the mods for misleading people."
Is it fake? He has his buddy standing in such a way it makes it seem as if the magnifying glass is the barrel
Natural selection dog. Don’t take yourself so seriously. If people are really buying shit they don’t want based on an offhand reddit comment that’s on them.
Conspiracy theory: op works for epic and who wants to make us buy the new pickaxe.
"It could be in random spots each game, it doesn’t necessarily make this fake because he saw it here and you didn’t."
"Yeah I did, I wish there was scam/misleading option tho."
"I know it's his buddy with the pickaxe, people reported that it is indeed fake."
"I see your point, but I doubt that people go about checking if every  user in this sub has a twitch channel with the same reddit username, unless it has TV, TTV, etc. In this case I believe that he intentionally hid his ingame name that had ""twitch"" in it to not get bad publicity for his channel for faking content. 

Then again, the post has a ""meme"" flair now. I don't think the flair was initially there when it was posted, but if it was then I am in the wrong to say that he's faking content for karma and hiding his channel to prevent bad publicity."
so we should report this guy who posted fake things....
If you’re gonna use it wrong at least spell it right r/woooosh
can anyone else confirm this is actually fake? we need a bit more evidence
"I thought the case was you can't see it at all unless you have the magnifying glass, sorry if I was wrong."
"Based on the mechanics of what I’ve seen from that picaxe so far is that it only magnifies things seen through it. Just because it’s a video game it doesn’t mean you can pull any idea out of your ass, claim that it’s true, and put down others because they are pointing out that the idea you pulled out of your ass is pretty crappy. "
"Depends on context of the sentence IMO...what's confusing me is the term date instead of day.  18th day of 7th month of 2018.  Date is the day/month/year.  Ugh, I'm over it now."
"But OP confirmed you can only see the numerals through the magnifying glass pickaxes. Did you just skip through half the thread just to argue?

 > Their win % did spike when that challenge went live, but it went from bad to worse from a Hero winrate perspective, not balanced to bad. We'll keep an eye on it and adjust again if necessary.

 > Chitauri leaving the match illustrates how strong their team is, since they still win the majority of the time even when outnumbered. It would have been easy to bring things in line by nerfing Thanos, but we are treating that as a last resort measure since we really wanted a powered-up Thanos to feel extremely strong.

 > Yes, which means it's impossible given the time remaining for the LTM & everyone working on season 9. If we are ever able to run the mode again (or do another with similar objectives), we'll be sure to fix that problem. For those who are curious, it's the camera shake knocking the reticle away from aiming at the stone that causes the counter to reset.

 > The amount of time it is currently set to gives the Hero team a bit of time to grab a weapon or two. Personally if I'm not chasing the first stone, I like to land in enemy territory and start leveling buildings (to cut down on # of chests).

 > Normally we would do something like that if the challenge was totally broken, but given that it's such a small percentage I think that's unlikely. Understood that this problem makes it a little harder to get a Stone, but it is still quite possible! I'd suggest trying to nab the first one like I mentioned elsewhere in this thread, and also pay close attention to the timing of the other stones. It i...

 > Teams are pretty even on PC, Thanos pulls ahead on console (easier to aim the Chitauri laser). We balance across all of them though, can't really do per device balancing in the modes :)

IT WAS LONG ENOUGH YOU SHOULD KEEP IT AT FIVE OR LOWER IT!!
"i’m so confused, my team has been getting consistently destroyed as chitauri, literally half the team ends up quitting within the first few minutes of the game. shits going to be impossible now..."
Not sure I agree with this one.  It took my buddies 7 matches just to pick up 2 stones.  Looks like getting that 3rd one is going to be hell.
"Annoying but fine.  Ill never get the challenge.

More annoying is that team mate attacks interrupt.  Every time i get to the stone first some try hard steals it from me."
"I honestly don't believe your stats regarding Chitauri winning 75% of the games. I think you have made an error w/ the stats.


what if the code had a bug and it was actually the hero team winning 75% of the time? that's probably what happened. You had the team labels reversed or had win / loss reporting reversed or something."
"So not only do Heroes get more powerful weapons that auto lock on to enemies but now the Chitauri have to wait even longer to pick up an Infinity Stone? Yeah, I think I'll pass. This mode is severely unbalanced. Ironic."
"This is only going to worsen the issue of the final stone being nearly impossible to pick up. Thanks. 

Fuck."
"I don't understand, was there some massive difference between the win rates on PC versus console?
Because when I played I only ever saw Chitauri win once every other match they got absolutely stomped on with zero hope of winning.

 Then when the challenges went live the Chitauri won every match but that was more to do with the fact the matches were 20 vs 5 as all the heroes quit the game so they could be put on the right team than balance between characters. For me if I was on the Chitauri my K/D would struggle to be 1 but as a hero I would happily run around with 20 kills and zero deaths."
"Man, come on, that's not balance, that's just making it even more annoying for the Chitauri."
I’ve played 9 games as team Thanos. We’ve lost every single one because it’s simply impossible to get the last stone. I had 52 kills as Thanos one game and still no one could grab it. All the hero’s weapons instantly destroy any buildings and they have way to much mobility for the chitari laser to be effective in guarding. I don’t think I’ve ever been this mad trying to do a challenge.
"I am not sure how this is better. I have had games where even after getting all the stones we still lost.

Even at max health and shields the heroes can kill the chitauri in 2 hits while it takes far more to kill a hero.

Chitauri have a max respawn limit while heroes have infinite until all stones are collected.

Chitauri have to farm mats while thors hammer can max out a character in minutes.

Heroes are auto aim while chitauri do not.

Chitauri jetpack is worse than the normal jetpack.

Captain America shield buffs heroes run speed and jump height, also blocks ALL damage.

Heroes have tons of buffs while the chitauri are at a severe disadvantage. Nerfing the pick up time just makes it worse. When I find out i'm chitauri, i just quit the match, its not worth it."
"Can we fix the stone pick up counter from getting reset if someone on your team blasts you? It’s so annoying, especially when you’re first to get there"
"u/MrPopoTFS how is it possible that my Chitauri ""teammates"" can bully/push me from getting the X Stone? Had a shot at becoming Thanos for the 1st time since the mode came out and the jerks kept shooting until I somehow lost control and the 7 sec timer resetted."
being in chitauri is so fucking boring now its just getting annoying.
"it would be okay to increase the time to pick up stones, but please buff chitauri, coz its such a disadvantage for the chitauri team, especially when theres a thor camping on the stone, 1 swing = 1 kill, and its even hard to pickup in 5 secs how much more if its 7"
"I swear to god everyone has different experiences.

My experience is Chitauris always damn leaving. Now it's going to be even worse and I feel bad for the ones doing their challenges late. Now with 7 seconds, they will leave even more.

Once I get that Logo banner and Glider, I'm done with the mode, once and for all. Seriously this mode is now a joke. Unfuckingbelievable."
WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT FIX THE FUCKING SHIT WHEN YOU'RE PICKING UP THE FIRST STONE AND THE OTHER PLAYERS ABILITY TO MAKE IT CANCEL OUT WHEN YOU'RE PICKING IT UP CHRIST
"this is the worst fucking adjustment to a game mode I have ever seen, now it's damn near impossible to do anything"
"Ok, so the last 3 or 4 stones spawned in enemy zone, it takes 7 seconds to pick up a stone and the enemy team can spam the zone of each stone with the arrow. How is that ""balance"" ?"
"If the Chitauri were still winning 75% of the time even though they usually had the smaller team because people dropped out and Iron Man has aimbot, that seems more unbalanced than this fix is going to correct... it's going to balance the win rate but not the fun ratio of being stuck on that side, people are going to drop out even more."
What the fuck. The infinity stone challenge was hard enough. I only have 2 still.
Welp looks like team thanos is going to have EVEN MORE trouble picking up the last stone when the opposite team keeps cancelling our grabs with their storm breaker spam
Should be removing the auto Aimbot crap from the Iron Man Gauntlets... The amount of times we've needed one stone to remove their respawns and the whole enemy team is in the air firing that crap everywhere is ridiculous
"Not liking the increase to grab as 5 seconds without getting hit was annoying enough. It'd be fine with a longer time to grab if getting hit didn't reset the grab time.

And before downvotes pour in for being against the norm, remember that downvotes are meant for off-topic/toxic discussion. It's not a dislike or disagreement button."
I hope 🤤 epic takes 600 vbucks 💰 off of the people 😱 who leave  😡
wow what the hell.... the chitauri team is already screwed as it is.. why did you do this... decrease it back please
"Bad nerf, some were already hard to get? What about iron man repulsors?"
"Hero’s win rate is so low because the only aim is to kill. 
Thanos army has to go and get the stones. There is no incentive to defend stones. 
Just play your game. 
Hardly anyone on the heroes team defends the stones because thats not the aim. The aim is to kill. 
People run round aimlessly trying to kill. 
I have no idea how this could be fixed and highly doubt it can be fixed this late in. 
Looking to the future it may be worth looking at the way teams win in a similar LTM’s (if there is any). 
However its been a great mode and epic have really pulled it out the mark with this merger!"
Or here's an idea. Nerf his laser. Two ticks to kill anyone after collecting the power stone? REALLY!?
Guess I won't get win 3 matches as villains done. Probably thanos can't even get stones.
"Prime example of numbers not lying, but failing to tell the whole truth.

&#x200B;

Game gets easier for team that isn't fun to play with when people quit because team isn't fun to play with. **THEY'RE TOO GOOD! NERF THEM!**

&#x200B;

Or, you know, make that team fun to play with so that the game balances itself out by working as intended with a roughly equal amount of players on both teams."
"I wanna complain about this but considering they said 60% of the thanos team was winning, this isn't that surprising nor this is as bad of a change as i thought it would be."
"Literally everyone:

Epic: Days since last fuck up: 0."
"1. Every weeks challenge makes imbalance in the team winning percentage due to other team quitting fast when not given the specific team on the start to complete the challenge (for example win as Thanos team 3 times - when spawned as hero - quit). This makes games for Thanos team easy to win because of 17:10 teams. It was the same for Hero team few days ago, when Hero challenges were on the table.  

2. Chitauris granade launcher weapon shoot at feet can break the Stone pickup cycle - my own team prolonged Stone pickup on many occasions just for fun, trolling or because they wanted to pickup the Stone because of the challenge. Total cancer. Also you cannot shoot granade launcher as a cover when other Chitauri is trying to pick up the Stone because IT BREAKS THE STONE PICKUP CYCLE.  

3. Chitauris weapon selection is small and you need to be skilled to use them - perfect hitscan & preload projectile explosive. On the other hand - Axe is one hit kill at close range + autoaim throw 2x100dmg, Shield is full dmg protection or homing throw spam, Iron man is flying and autoaim shooting. Real skill weapon is the bow - but it does 200 dmg + grapple is insane for the movement.  
Axe is ok, Shield should do less dmg, Iron man gloves should not be autoaim, Bow is ok. That way - people who take more than one Hero item (which is most of the people) would not have so many spam/autoaim weapons to use. As a Chitauri you cannot do nothing to escape, block, evade these attacks, especially if there is more than one Hero."
Aka I’m quitting every time in on the Chitarui side
"People complaining are honestly stupid and/or have never worked in a game business. Just because you lost as the bad guys, doesn’t mean everyone is. They obviously changed it for a reason. There stats show that the hero’s are winning less."
"I think the Chitari blaster just needs a slight buff ex. Buff headshot damage or just increase overall damage by 10, it takes so many shots to kill the heroes."
Even the bloody shield and hammer have aim bot. Cant build against them no matter how hard you try.
"I was in the middle of picking up a stone and was blasted repeatedly resetting my counter, there was at least 4 people trying at one point with no success"
"Same, as well as the infinity stones challenge. This update is worthless."
"From what ive read, it appears that console players have the most trouble against Thanos team. Its the PC lobbies where Avengers are overpowered. It makes sense, the Chitauri benefit from having guns and probably aim assist, while the avenger weapons dont exactly behave like guns."
"If they are quitting shortly after the first stone arrives then they are likely trying to complete the Endgame challenge by picking up the first stone - which is generally the easiest to get.

If they are quitting before that point, then they probably started the game wanting to be on the hero team, weren't paying attention in the lobby, and quit after they realized the game had started.  Not speaking from experience here or anything."
I was the lone player on my team about a half dozen time the other day after the first or second stone drop.
"they're listing purely off of data which tells them villains win more often and i just cannot comprehend how that is. most of us have all played at least a dozen or two games of this LTM at this point and how often do the bad guys even win? it almost never happens because even at just 5 seconds, you essentially need 1 of 2 things to happen to retrieve the final 2 stones. one is hero team being incompetent morons that build up over stones but have no one keeping watching on the inside of the builds to prevent the enemy from sneaking in and using the buildings to shield themselves from being seen or attacked. the other is whoever becomes thanos IMMEDIATELY divebombs the stone and sacrifices themselves to retrieve it. assuming they don't get pushed out of the timer somehow, they will have enough shields and HP to manage to grab the stone even if they're being bombarded by the whole hero team.

the latter almost never ever happens in my experience and while stupid hero teammates are a common occurrence, you seriously only need 1 or 2 archers watching a stone or 1 archer and someone on the ground with a shield/axe to sufficiently protect a stone most of the time."
"i actually like the multiple weapon thing, one weapon is pretty boring to use.

what they should really do is give a giant ass buff to team thanos, health/shield increase plus the weapon damage for the chitauri"
"the shield... that shield is way OP. I accidentally get 3 kills while trying to get one, A LOT."
"unless the ENTIRE team is building a fortress around the stones, i'd say its actually impossible for the heroes to lose if they know what they're doing. chitauri always try building on the stones and yet they always die because it takes like 1 second to destroy those structures of so many as 3 heroes are playing the objective. and if at least one of them is using the bow, you're taking heavy damage even when its not a direct hit."
"Why? They literally nerfed chitauri because of how easy it is to win as them. Even now, it's still *closer* to even."
"epic are the people who rammed the infinity sword into the game in competitive modes. . . 

when they say chitauri was winning 75% of the matches I just know they are dumb and wrong. They messed something up, horribly. That statistic is not accurate."
any 1 building around the stone in the heroes team is helping the chitauri team that means he is crossteaming and should be permanently banned >!/s!<
That would make Hawkeye useless. The grappler is already buggy and doesn’t fire half the time anyway
"Couldnt it be they are winning because so many people on the teams leave? Because of how many people leave its way harder to get to 100 kills because there are fewer people to kill, i feel like it would be better if people to kill was a percentage of people ingame after a certain time."
"True. But the fun factor is low when playing as the Chitauri  compeared to the hero's. Rather play as the hero's even if i lose more. Chitauri are just boring, when i die as one i get annoyed since i know my death was because of an aimbotter rather than skill."
"Thanos is only a threat with the Soul and Space Stones. Without a full Gauntlet or even missing just one of these two, very vital stones sets him at a ***massive*** disadvantage and he **will** be killed very quickly in combat. To nerf him is to kill the mode itself."
"But Thanos wins every time but 1 in the 14 million-odd scenarios according to Infinity War, right?


That said, heroes having the ability to hold more than 2 weapons that nearly all have homing capabilities is really bothersome to play against, and is one major reason everyone quits to play heroes."
Sure they win more but it's not fun to play as the Chitauri.
"This change just makes the most tedious and least fun aspect of the mode even worse. You should do away with the interact with the stones mechanic and turn them into a Domination point. Stand close to capture, more players = faster capture, and it doesn't stop you from shooting and building. Then you can increase the time it takes to capture to compensate."
"Like, did you guys try to differentiate between platforms?  There seems to be a huge difference between reports from people on mobile and console and ones from people on PC."
">Team Thanos was winning WAY too often - around 75% of all matches.

Seriously? I think its a reverse card mate. Team Thanos can't even grab the god damn stone in the first place. Do you think 7 seconds is balanced? you're out of your damn mind man! at least give team Thanos a melee weapon for Christ sakes"
"i'm sorry, i just cannot believe what you're telling us. NOBODY likes playing as team thanos unless they are thanos and even then thanos dies constantly throughout the match because he really isn't that overpowered. not unless u have amazing luck with which stones drop and even then he still feels far weaker than last year. his minions all suck as well and i've seen games were 70 lives on the final stone were not enough to help them. because if the hero team ISN'T STUPID all it takes is them spamming their weapons on the last stone's location and even thanos won't be able to pick it up. guaranteed now that it's a 7 second pickup."
"they’re usually quitting prior to the game starting which is making me think the latter of your points is true, this has happened in every (no exaggeration) game i’ve played on Thanos’ side; my team has always been at least 5 players down and we get destroyed as a result"
"Until that time hits it is literally useless to even land as the chitauri, let alone fight. Could you hotfix it to 3:30 so one team doesn't have to not play for the 1st minute of each game?"
Speaking of chitauri side and avenger side could we make the glide in after respawn a little higher in the air? But lower when the circle is small?
"The stormbreaker is the worst, makes it literally impossible for a stone to get grabbed if you keep chucking them while the Chitauri attempt to build cover."
"Lol, please don't advocate for a perm ban for something like this.

I was doing it all night last night and didn't realize it was hurting my team until coming to this thread. I thought it was helpful for them but it makes sense that its not.

Better to have the clear line of sight"
"Complete opposite imo.

Once the circle has closed enough and the final stone is out, heroes will just kill anything within the circle/near the stone.

Chitauri will always lose if their Thanoses and fellow Chitauri are mentally handicapped."
"Caps shield is actually worse than everything for me. Even if I build a box it comes in and kills me. It just feels so broken to both use and play against. 

Just did my Cap shield damage challenge and killed someone in a box as well. Just throw it and insta kill someone on the return hit."
Yea that’s what I’m saying. Having less people to kill will make it harder to reach for 100 kills which helps the chituari team a lot
"I just meant that they are trying to complete the Endgame challenge, which indeed is to pick up *any* of the stones.  But many players try to collect the first stone by popping their umbrella right after they get off the bus, and waiting until the stone is inbound so they can guess the trajectory and try to land at it first.  If you don't do that, for future stones it's basically up to luck if you are close enough to a stone when it lands to be able to pick it up before someone else does.

Many players quit if they don't get the first stone for that exact reason.  They don't want to waste time with RNG hoping one lands near them during the rest of the game.

Sorry if I wasn't clear."
Sometimes I’m getting shot at by 4 aliens and I’m spamming right click on the ground in front of me or a tree and nothing happens.
"This, so much this. Now is OP which I love as a hero and hate that more teammates don’t use it"
"Maybe some of it is platform or region dependent.  Thanos team success is very reliant on 1) heroes goofing around instead of focusing on the dub; and 2) making good use of Thanos.

I think the main reason Thanos team wins is they don't really have anything to do but play for objectives, the heroes are intrinsically fun to play so the heroes tend to be much less objective focused or not even care about objectives at all.  Also the chest spawn rate in this mode is super low so heroes can spend quite a while running around map to get their loadout, because all of the hero items are fun to use so it is nice to get them, but in the mean time the Thanos team has nothing to do but get objectives as fast as possible since even Thanos isn't really fun to play like the heroes he's just strong."
"> Cap shield damage challenge and killed someone in a box as well. Just throw it and insta kill someone on the return hit.

If you want to get all try hard you can throw thor hammer and then switch to iron man shield and block with iron man shield while thor hammer is out magicking around killing stuff. :D"
im getting genuinely frustrated and angry that even though im the first one at the stone. The first one to start collecting the stone. I still manage to not become thanos because my team mates can stop me from collecting.
"Sounds like a failure in testing. How did y'all not realize that Chitauri team mates could interrupt each other? You should be no strangers to griefing in this game, and I'm surprised you didn't forsee this."
"Then update it, I just got screwed over by somebody doing that, no wonder people are leaving"
This game mode is trash because you guys miss simple shit like that. Bring back old thanos mode. Borderlands 3 can’t come soon enough
"Spam building doesn't save you from the axe though, it instantly breaks through buildings and does guaranteed damage on both the through and the return."
"Everyone has stats, and stats tell most people what they want to hear.  It's extremely important to test your stats against experience because stats are often wrong, flawed, or misinterpreted.  Anyone who ever worked in data for any organisation ever could tell you a million horror stories about the misunderstanding and misuse of ""stats""."
"the ""publicity"" I'm getting out of it is publicity as to exactly how bad epic games is at game design and balance , and patching."
"It's funny that you say this, and yet they've made this hot fix because Thanos was winning 75% of matches.

Disagree all you like. Maybe that means that all the kids insta-quitting Chitauri are idiots (admittedly likely), but the numbers are still insanely relevant."
I'm more basing the fact that he might not know the actual feels of 100000s players but they certainly have 10000s of games played. I know what stats are so I'm not bashing you in anyway. This is the same currently in the professional scene with FN. The pros are frustrated with the current state of the game and that's certainly more important than whatever stats they have. The only reason they are playing right now because of the money/streaming.
"100% of the team should defend stones. 

chasing kills and leaving stones exposed sounds like the only possible way to lose."
"because game design and balance are not everything. 

Epic is good at content. Price point. and engine development. They are good at cosmetics and battlepass and responding to community feedback. they are good at creating new game modes rapidly, and often, even if some of them like End game are not balanced, it's made up for by it being very temporary, new, and thus semi interesting even in unbalanced form. 

I'm not an epic games hater, but lets at least be able to discuss their weaknesses besides their strengths."
"I mean, maybe?

You're talking about some REALLY FUCKING DEEP analytics. And, while I have no doubt that they can look at how much time users have spent in certain modes, I have serious doubts that these two different categories can be easily placed side by side. That functionality may not exist. Having worked closely with a company that deals a lot in development work for websites and SaaS systems, I feel competent enough to assert that Epic might not have the ability to directly compare these two different qualifiers because of the work of would've required to make it possible. I mean, they're not going to have added it for this specific LTM.

That sort of analysis, win rate as compared to experience, doesn't really come into the equation for the base game. And since the game got really big, they certainly haven't had the time. I'm sure you've read the reports.

Lastly, I think that having such vast differences in experience between the two sides is insanely unlikely (although slightly more likely since they implemented the super squad functionality).

I think the more important thing to ask is:

Are they studying win rates on different platforms? There are certain tendencies that can be extrapolated from users on different platforms that can help to deduct at least a few broad-brush details about how and why the mode might be unbalanced. But since this is likely a one week only mode, and never again... Well, we're just arguing over theoreticals, really."
That’s probably the biggest reason. On PC Chitauri have nothing to help aim while the Avengers have two aimbot weapons being the Iron Man and Cap weapons
"Obviously its variable the quality of your teammates, and whether or not ppl leave the game - those things make it difficult on both sides. But honestly it only takes like 9 or 10 competant chitauri to win. Players who immediately bumrush stones as they appear before all the heros can get there, spam build around the stones, can kill 2 or 3 heroes per respawn, and get down to the last stone with like 50-60 respawns left and it's over. When I am on chitauri side, I float on my parachute using geysers to get to like the first 3 or 4 stones asap. These people complaining hardcore are the guys that are shooting you to reset the first gem timer to become Thanos, quitting immediately, and/if they stay they are crouch walking in open fields spraying the energy cannon indiscriminantly crying cuz you have to track somebody for 2 or 3 seconds."
"Yeah, great point, now that I think about it having controller aim assist would make a crazy difference in favor of Chitauri, that is probably why people have such divergent reports between PC and console."

"Until further confirmation from more sources, we have no idea if this is real or fake. Looking pretty small and it wouldn't surprise me if somebody tried to bamboozle the community by 3D-printing their own Tomato Head.

Take this post with a grain of salt.

Edit: After doing some research of my own, I'm 99% sure this is fake. OP lives in Israel so he'd be nowhere near the DurrBurger head, he has a history of 3D modeling, the sand underneath the Tomato Head looks to be a pedestal made to look like sand, obvious Photoshop error in second picture top left, forced perspective to make it look bigger but quite clear it's small.

I'll keep the thread up because it's still pretty good OC, but this is not a part of the ARG."

"Upvotes for content about which I'm ambivalent because *oh my god, fuck all you horrible assholes.*"
"Wow, he's bad, didn't even get a single star in the easiest cup. Then again I was also quite bad as a 4 year old, so I can't really blame him."
"Damn, y'all are cold. The dad was just trying to honor his son's wishes and make him Internet famous. This kid is probably stoked right now. And everyone is hating. This subreddit is always filled with shit like this, people who enjoyed it or liked it keep upvoting it. Then the people who didn't enjoy it or thought it was shit go to the comment section to voice their opinion. As if it makes a difference. "
You're a terrible influence on your son. I've reported you to Reddit Child Services. People that shitpost like this shouldn't be allowed to have kids.
I'm slowly edging closer and closer to that unsubscribe button
I love how the entire comment section is just trashing on OP but yet this post just gets more and more karma
"Neither can I, even though i'm a 24 year old man. But that is more because the kinect is a useless unresponsive piece of shit."
This is the first comment I can find not about OP being a shit-posting karma whore. Thank you.
"I mean, it's a pissing contest now, but my 4 year old brother beat all my assassin's creed games and has a rudimentary grasp on the underlying themes. But he also insists on pissing outside and only eating bread. So it's give and take."
"As a man named Mordechai who once as 4, I feel his pain. "
"you've been a redditor for 2 years, and yet here you are asking what a piece of shit post is doing in /r/gaming. 


"
"Yea this post just screams ""shitty dad"".

Edit: I guess the cereal box that I got my internet parenting assessment license from had a misprint. "
These sorts of titles are utter bull shit too. Why would your kid ask you to upload a photo of themselves to the internet? And how would they know about reddit? Unless all op does is talk about reddit to his kids all the time.
"According to random people in comments sections, every subreddit and website ever is shit. I'm sure you're shit too."
"Wow you're one to call out people for karma grabs. Saying ""The point of posting in a subreddit is to give content"" but your history has submissions to this sub that didn't really add any content. 

[Skyrim Screenshot](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/yc5ti/the_beauty_of_skyrim_still_amazes_me/) - No Content here just a freaking Screen shot....wow. 

[Another Screen Shot](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hnpr5/this_is_the_ugliest_kid_i_have_ever_seen/) - This one is from a game you don't even bother to identify and has zero content relating to games.

[Here's a submission that's a picture of a receipt](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/u4b7u/just_sold_24_games_to_gamestop_for_360_normally/) - This submission's content relating to games = 0. It would have been better submitted to /r/frugal. 

If you want people to stop submitting shit content to /r/gaming maybe you should start. "
"Yeah. This sub is shit. ""Shitty memes and 14 year old humor? Yes please. Is that a kid? Fuck everything and everyone"""
"Seriously, who the hell cares. Why the hell is this on the front page of /r/gaming?"
"Out of all the posts, you complain about this one. What about all the shitty memes, or that old one with the ""I have no games to play"" caption that is on the frontpage every single month."
"Maybe he is playing as his father's character...as in OP. Now you're mocking OP for a name, thats just not nice"
">  Really though, where do you assholes get off? Just downvote and leave it at that. No need for your shitty analysis of their family life or whether or not they're karma whoring.

Because, if they don't comment they can't get their own sweet, sweet comment karma.

They're karma whores bitching about karma whores to get karma."
"Seriously dude, buncha whiney little bastards coming out of the woodwork to shit on this guys happiness.  Anonymity is a cruel bitch ~~sometimes~~ every time.  [Here's my take](http://www.myteenagewerewolf.com/home/lauren/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/schools-out-games.jpg) for all the hate."
And that is when my son and I laughed as he grasped my hands and we rode off to the animal shelter to adopt an abused animal to post in /r/pics and a ripe banana to post in /r/wtf
"Because it's /r/gaming, a subreddit not devoted to focus on a particular matter, just loosely circling around games and gaming. I upvoted it because it's sweet but i get it why people are getting upset (although most of them are assholes).

Also, people that like something are less likely to comment on that than assholes that just wants to thrash someone because they don't like their content. Welcome to the internet!"
"this is fucking retarded though. who gives a shit about ops kids weak score. and why does this guy tell his kids about his ""internet friends?"" what the fuck is going on here"
Now why would you go and do that making me all manmotional :(
"Linda, honey, listen

we have to leave the house your dad is being a karma freak again"
"Or he just took a photo of his son and posted it on Reddit with a fake title. But then again, who would tell lies on the internet?"
"/r/games is just as shitty, just more on topic.

And /r/truegaming is /r/games but really fucking pretentious.

It's all shit, it just comes in different flavors and consistency."
"My little sister tried to pull this shit on me with MK7.  

""Oh I finished all the 150cc races!""

""I don't see any gold stars in there, try again, loser"""
"If I had a nickel for every time my dad gave a shit about something I did, I'd be flat broke. Keep on being a rad dad."
Lol dude dont even pay attention to them. Most of the redditors in this thread have nothing better to do than be vocal about their hate on /r/gaming like everyday
Yo man the people that are hating are absolute twatheads so ignore em
Not everyone turns into a massive inconsiderate dick head after having browsed reddit for a year. 
"And then tape the banana to the animals head, and post a unicorn to /r/aww"
"3. A moderator deletes the thread, because it is off-topic garbage.

Just kidding, that never happens."
I usually come to the comments section to make sure at least someone is as outraged as I am that this shit is upvoted so much. 
"I don't get why people are upset. I get why they might roll their eyes and move on, but there is real anger in here. So pointless."
"If we're talking borderlands 1 you were stupid to play as anyone but Roland, that motherfucker was so OP."
"Hell yes! There comes a point in every Mordechai's life where he becomes a man, and at that point it is quite badass to be named Mordechai.

I got shown [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsBp3Vcnp5o) by some dude at a bar this past weekend and it freaked me out though."
"No, it does because this is a social site where people post things that other may find interesting, if you don't then move on. Want to join in on a discussion? By all means. If the picture didn't interest you, you would have moved on and not be a complete douche about it. You know like how you do when you hear a parent on the street celebrate a child's seeming small accomplishment. But this is your chance to really let someone know how much of a cunt you are; by shitting on a dad and his kid. Just digest that. A dad who is sharing time and interest in his son, decided to share with the world is somehow a weirdo, in your eyes, because he posted on reddit. The reality is that you are a sociopath with the idea that what you are doing ""being real"". No ass, you're being a rude dipshit. there's a difference between not caring and actively being an asshole. 1 involves just, moving on, not somehow defending the idea that people should be shitheads.. 
"
"I think people are just tired of facebook posts. There's already a lot of trivial shite posted here and people just don't want this to be a trend, I guess.

With that said, posts are voted to the top by other redditors. The people who liked the pic far outnumber the ones who don't like it, so let the haters hate."
"It's not even sweet. To begin with, people OP doesn't know aren't his friends. Secondly, this isn't even interesting. "
"Sick opinion, bro. Your opinions are out of control everyone knows that."
Oh god... I would hate to see what your penis looks like.
"Welcome to Reddit, where people destroy their brand new, expensive things for fake internet points."
Are you able to use it with the PS3 because if no why the hell would you open it?
"Wtf man, your entire controller looks disgusting. What the hell do you do with that thing, dip it in acid? Wash your damn hands once in a while."
The test units in Argos are like this. But that's probably down to kids abusing them.
I'm inclined to believe that this is an isolated incident. I doubt they would release the controllers in such poor condition 
"I don't understand how this happens, 110+ hours of Battlefield 4, 20+ hours of borderlands 2 on my ds4 and  It's as good as new! What the hell are you people doing to these poor controllers?"
"I remember my sister borrowed my 360 controller years back, and she uses the thumbstick WITH HER GODDAMN THUMB NAIL.

So when I got it back, it had giant gouges taken out of the left thumbstick and I wanted to punch her."
"It's hard to judge the durability of this ONE unit from this ONE guy.  Cayos, I'm not knocking you but we just don't know the conditions under which this controller was stored, how hard you use it, or if this is just a one in a 1000 defect.  

That being said, yeah, this is discouraging.  I've read too many reviews saying this controller is the shit.  I'm really starting to concerned with the quality of gaming reviews and reporting.
"
What the fuck did you do to the controller? The system isn't even out. 
"After the PS2, the PS3, the Xbox, and the Xbox 360 - I just don't buy first runs of new consoles. Let someone else suffer the misaligned lasers, red rings, broken drives, etc. - I've got plenty of games to play in the meantime."
Why the fuck is it so dirty? Do you use yours as a plate for your toast?
"Can't say I've had this problem and I've been using it for the past five days on my PS3, putting in at least 25 hours of BO2 with two of my buddies. "
All I want to know is what the hell you were doing with it for over a week for it to fall apart like that O_o
I would be pissed ..... Email Sony and see if they will replace it for u
ill probably be modding my ps3 sticks onto the ps4 controller.
If that's real I think that says more about the crap quality of the controller more so than how much you game bro.
"But if it were an Xbox One Controller, Reddit would be up in arms for another Circlejerk of hate."
This means we have and XBoner hating on Sony's work
Did he really just damage his controller for fake internet points?
My sister does this shit with my 360 controllers. I don't understand why anyone needs to dig their nails into the analog stick.
"There are scratches on the thumbstick, he broke it on purpose."
"I also found his hat at the scene of the crime!!!
http://imgur.com/WHbrabm"
"My original PS2 controller broke about 1-2 years back, but that bastard went over 10 years with constant use."
"Now you've reminded me of the horror I saw on my stepbrothers' Wii U Basic. White gamepad, orange thumbsticks =\

Edit: typo"
"I call it ""cheetle"", and those who ruin controllers with it are referred to as ""cheetle fiends."""
"Mmm... we always called it chizz.

""Damnit, who chizzed on the remote?!"""
Oil and other acids will eat through most any material. Maybe OP is really messy and uses too much force at the same time?
Like-wise been working with various iterations of the controllers for well over a year and we have a bunch of production controllers in the office nothing like this has happened. We are all looking at this going WTF (O_o)
"Oh god, Mario party.  I didn't realize my palms could retract back inside my hands, but there they scurried in fear."
"No, most other people aren't willing to spend 60 bucks to fuck up a controller on purpose though."
This week is going to be filled with this nonsense. I may unplug from the internet until it blows over.
"> don't grind the analog sticks on a brick wall for hours

pfft, casual noob. lp2. this is why you can't headshot"
"They look like big, good, strong hands. Don't they? I always thought that's what they were. My little friends. The little man with his racing snail, the Nighthob, even the stupid bat. I couldn't hold on to them. The nothing pulled them right out of my hands. I failed."
"A friend of mine plays like that. The first time we played Xbox together I noticed a bunch of black rubber ""crumbs"" on my couch after she left. I didn't know what they were, but when I went to put the controllers away I noticed the analog sticks were clawed to hell. "
How is that not super uncomfortable? I hate pressure being applied to my nails.
"we cal those ""sanding particles"" the come about when OP uses sandpaper to make a shitty fake ass post."
Just think of all the people who see this and don't look at the comments though.  If OP is trying to hurt the PS4 it's working.
"It's amazing how much an opinion can change with a little analysis. When I first saw this in /r/PS4, I thought 'Wow, guess I should watch out,' but after seeing the supposed email proof and taking a closer look at the alleged stick, I can confirm the OP faggotry level is quite high."
"As much as the circlejerk is a real thing, I feel like, even if this were an Xbox One controller, people would call bullshit at the painfully obvious damage (not wear-and-tear) to the controller."
"Nah I just doubt that you use sand paper when you jack it. Seriously controllers don't wear down like that, only things that are sanded do. "
Why are there scratch marks on the analog stick? I call bullshit.
"Like terrible solder used on heat-sinks. Causing the failure of millions of units.

Edit: Ok, it was the solder used on the GPU. The heat-sink issues were different, brain mashed the two together."
"Had experience with this directly at my company.  We're not a video games company, we're a housewares manufacturer.  We have a scale in Pampered Chef and during production, the factory ran out of the glue that is used to attach the glass plate to the base of the scale and just decided they'd substitute a different glue on the fly.  Well, unfortunately that glue didn't work with whatever the two materials were that it was supposed to be bonding, so Pampered Chef got like 10,000 scales where the platform wouldn't stay attached.

That was an expensive mistake.
"
Not at my work. Things have to go through way to many screenings and checks before use to have counterfeit or bad materials. 
"Happened to me on a TV control room upgrade. We ordered miles of cable rated for HD-SDI but a few boxes were this counterfeit shit that wouldn't really pass anything. We were stunned, I mean the boxes all came from the same company, were sealed and everything. We had ZERO way of knowing."
"I get about a year and a half out of an xbox controller, the right bumper starts giving out at that point. I know I'm a little hard on them, but it's my fault.

Analogs are necessary. If it's happening to a small portion at 1 week, without the console being out, it's not a good sign."
"What's that dust speck, right there behind, no-- ON THE FUCKING SCREEN?! Dude. So mess."
">They look like big, good, strong hands. Don't they? I always thought that's what they were. My little friends. The little man with his racing snail, the Nighthob, even the stupid bat. I couldn't hold on to them. The nothing pulled them right out of my hands. I failed.

Pyornkrachzark"
"Calling bullshit on this as well.  I've had mine for over 2 weeks and been using it for 6+ hrs everyday and also my 5 year old has been messing with it a lot on top of that.  It looks nothing like OPs picture and is still in perfect condition.

Obvious bullshit is obvious, you can see where he sanded/filed the rubber off and the marks on the plastic *under* the rubber.."
"I had heard that the solder issue was due to regulations on lead being used in the solder?  Then since EU banned the use of lead in solder they had use the sub par solder.  

But of course it's total conjecture.  "
"Not heatsinks per se - rather the BGA array that soldered the graphics chips to the motherboard. Hence why a fix of it is called 'BGA reflow' if you're just heating it up, or 'BGA reball' if you actually want it to work for more than a week. Though even reballs were unreliable in the end, unless you fixed heat dissipation. 

I never dealt with this issue on consoles, but I do computer repair and plenty of Dell, HP (the greatest amount)  and Apple (none of the MacBooks, but all of the MBPs) laptops failed that way. In fact, every laptop with nVidia 6xxx, 7xxx and *especially* 8xxx graphics failed that way. ATI seemed to have largely avoided this issue. Interestingly enough though, ATI made the Xbox graphics chips. They started out 90nm, then went 65nm but now are 45nm and instead of Northbridge they or on the CPU die, so the current Xboxes are immune to the dreaded GPU failure. "
"More like he pays for the good shit, the company making it sends him the cheap shit labeled as the good shit, and he has no way of testing to confirm."
"Whilst in other news the steam pad has managed to cure cancer, fedoras are being thrown in the air at the arrival of the steam box, also known as gebus the Lord and savior gabens son."
"Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day.

Teach a man to fish, and he can [look up this shit himself](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=op)."
"I really hope the person that caused the heat-sink issue was fired, and barred from any tech-related job. Sounds mean, but he/she caused 100s of millions of dollars in damages."
"I import my solder from china because unleaded solder is total fucking garbage.

It's like paint, they tell us we can't have high VOC oil based paints now, which is ridiculous. It's shit for the environment, instead of a paint job lasting 2 years, now it'll last 6 months tops before it's beginning to look yellowed meaning you have to repaint all the fucking time.

It's trash invented by people who have never used the products in the real world."
Also remember Microsofts old DRM policy.  For a while you couldn't transfer DLC or arcade games to other consoles like you can today.  So you'd get your console back but you'd have to buy your DLC and shit again.

"So, DAE just le old school Nintendo? Downvoted to oblivion, etc etc.

"Needs breaking bad references too,as if there isn't a subreddit where someone posted about that show."
I'm downvoting this not because it isn't GTA (I've never played it and don't care about it) but because it isn't interesting in any way.
Oh my god people shut the FUCK up. This place was The Last of Us all say every day for weeks and no one said anything. Get the fuck over it.
This is the future of this sub. Fuck all of you shits
"I have seen more posts on the front page of r/gaming about subverting ""GTA mania"" than I actually have about GTA. You know what's great about having a huge subreddit devoted to gaming? That when a huge exciting title gets released, reddit hates on people for talking about it *before they've actually started talking about it*"
"This is dumb. We get it, there's a lot of talk about GTAV. Fair - because it's a massive release of a game people have been waiting a long time for. It's one of the biggest and most expensive media releases in history. 

If you don't want to hear about GTAV, then don't read this subreddit for a bit. Big deal. 

Why whine and post something pointless and unoriginal. "
it'll get buried because your blatant attempt at reverse psychology will fail miserably 
*Let's take this motherfucker to the front page so he/she can learn not to tell us what to do.*
"And shitty content. Here, let me take a picture of an NES controller and post it with subreddit commentary instead of a title relating in any way to the NES!

Then I can bitch about the subreddit when it fails!"
seriously the posts bitching about the GTA mania are far more cancerous than the GTA mania it's self and this is coming from someone who doesn't even play GTA
It's totally insensitive and more than slightly racist.
"well this is more of a two fer one comment. haleyfax, it is original content. GTA started on the Nes. Didn't ya know.

and Nermid. It's better than anything you have likely put up.-edit- I was wrong. i apologize nermid, you have been quite active it appears. much more so than i.-end edit-
 and once again. Nes is home of first GTA."

"Digital Artist for video games here,  I see a lot of dragons made in zbrush zsphere which is a terrible way to go about making your base model for a game.  If you want to do it right, you should be building your base models in Maya (no more than 4k polys for a main char dragon each) and then importing to Zbrush to build your normal maps.  I'm going to take a wild guess and say that those dragons you have were built in those positions they are in, nothing is rigged with a bone structure correct?  Your models should be built in a default position and rigged before you try and move them into positions that look lifelike for screen shots.

Also concept images are what should come first, then the 3d models, not many people do the 3d first then the concept.  You should start by designing the environments for which your dragons will live.  This will determine how your dragons should look. 

Have you thought about which game engine you are going to use?  You know that most cost a ridiculous amount of money correct?  Unity is free but those models you have will never work in Unity.
 
I really hate to bust your balls on this one, but your taking all the wrong steps first to create the game.  Stay away from Zbrush until the game is almost finished.  There's no logical way you should be using Zbrush this early on in your game development."
So you've been working on this for 2 years and haven't actually created anything yet? Might wanna worry about that before the website...
"Seriously, Reddit? A ""I have a great idea for a game! But nothing to show for it"" post gets to the frontpage?
  
Why is this any different from the millions of other go-nowhere projects announced by bored lonely people one weekend before they lose interest a few weeks later?
  
I KNOW I'll get downvoted for this, but Jesus, have some perspective. Good projects are not announced like this until they have a **solid footing in reality**. *This* is nothing but attention-whoring. These aren't even prototype shots-- they're composited concept art made from pre-made backgrounds.
  
We won't hear a thing about this project ever again. I'd say ""mark my words"", but after today, it will be buried and forgotten forever."
TIL you can make it to the frontpage with complette fake bullshit.
"It would be cool if it were semi-permadeath.  If you die, you don't get to rez your super-mega-dragon. You instead get to choose one of your offspring to control.  If you have no offspring, or are just starting out, you get spawned in someone else's bloodline.  And some battle scars could become permanent, so the big and powerful dragons would be forced to avoid griefing."
No one seems to have asked yet...  do you have any dates for anything yet?  Beta?  Launch?  Anything?
What's the gameplay? Are you fighting monsters or something or just milling about?
I'm failing to see how science has anything to do with dragons.
This sounds horrifically interesting! I can't wait to see where this goes!
"Do you have anything other than these pictures to show for it thus far? You say you've been developing for 2 years, what's come from that? 

Is this *supposed* to be similar to Spore, but MMO and more realistic? How do you plan to fund a fully featured MMO, they aren't cheap. Even massive game companies don't like to take risks on MMOs."

Thankfully, me and 50% of the /r/gaming (the other 50% are white knights for the tits and can't stand watching a girl take a little bit of criticism) have seen this pile of shit for what it is and know that 1 person can't possibly develop an MMO from scratch and keep it running, especially with what has been shown so far."

Execution is the only thing that holds any value.

Please people, keep this in mind:

Ideas are only the raw, quick-drying cement - you still need to pick a location, get the permits, clear and prep the ground, add water in proper proportion, mix it at the proper speed, pour it, level it, keep feet from walking all over it (or idiots from pissing all over it) and open it up to the public (hoping you made something people aren't tripping all over).

At least I think that's how it should be.

"If your video card does not support some of the features used by the graphics engine, the game will not look as good as it can, no matter what you set the game to.  We need to know what hardware this screenshot was taken on.

"Hell, I bet the textures didn't even get to load up."
"maybe thats what they were going for, make the file ridiculously huge so theres no pirating, yet the game really is only like 6-8 gigs, the rest is just filler crap with no purpose."
But damn look how smooth that scope edge is. I'm sure you were so blown away by that you didn't even notice how terrible the textures in the rest of the environment are.
It seems the only thing they manage to render and give decent textures are the guns and character models. Everything else is just pure garbage.
Not that I care which either of these quite stale franchises sell better but I find it funny that battlefield 3 to 4 has essentially done what modern warfare has done the last few years yet people are rooting for it to win the title of the best selling multiplayer modern military shooter in 2013.

Doubt it. He saw it stir shit on 4chan and is using it to stir shit here.

"That's because of the model's uv map - the way the texture is wrapped around the tree model.

In order for the texture to properly wrap around the tree, there needs to be a seam. This is most noticable on lower quality settings, with low texture resolution.

I drop to about 45 fps with max settings.  I drop to 45 fps in BF4 after the levelotion in shanghai.  I can't explain that.
When your engine is popping textures directly in front of you on max settings its got serious LoD issues (nudging at Rage...).

"Back during their E3 conference, they mentioned how they have revolutionary AI and how fish would move away when you got near.

Yea it's either this or shit optimization due to lack of correct coding in development.
"what a stupid move, since they exclude everyone running 32bit os, which is most people... and a lot of people only have 4GB... "
"As someone who was an avid player of 1942 and BF2, I'm disappointed in the direction DICE has taken the series. For one thing, I think they should have stuck to the core and made Battlefield a multi-player only title. Leave the single player campaign to the Bad Company games. Also, they shouldn't be putting out a new game every year. Yes, I know it make sense from a business standpoint, but it's frustrating as a consumer."
"Maybe ""idiots"" was a bit too harsh a choice of label.

It is disconcerting to me, however, that people click upvote without actually thinking about what they are upvoting.

In this instance, it's really harmless, but if they had taken a moment to think, ""Hm, that doesn't look quite right,"" and simply clicked the comments, they'd have left the thread knowing that what they had just seen was inaccurate, and likely intended to deliberately confuse them.

When it happens with graphics in a video game, it's no big deal, but that mentality translates easily into other topics of discussion as well, and the only way to hone it is to apply the bullshit filters to most of what you read.

Anyway, I'm probably taking this too seriously. It just bugs me, because I know at some point in the future, I'm going to have to correct other people who use this as an example and try to make a point. That, in and of itself, is not a problem. The problem is that when people can't tell the difference between bullshit and reality on the internet, everything starts to be labeled as bullshit, even when it's accurate (or vice versa).

See: Global warming studies, video game behavioral studies, politics."
How do you feel about grenades and the flashbangs ? they really bothered me during the campaign because they feel like they did nothing at all.
"The gun is a largely static model. The more gun the game renders, the more hard stuff it can ignore.

That's why gun sizes in-game have steadily increased as the consoles got older."
"It's not even shit optimisation, many pc players have reported Ghosts using 2Gb at most. It's some weird software coding, unofficial player patch out on day 1 too."
No its BS. I bought it this morning and ran it before coming to work; I have 6gb ram and the game was maxing out my ram. I'm thinking it might be a memory leak though since I was getting some terrible frame rate even with 6gigs ram on a i7 with a ati 5970
Its been two years since BF3? Unless they released some new crazy battlefield in between 3 and 4 that I wasn't aware of.
"Look out your fucking window you lazy piles of shit!

"You're right, but often when it's a hot button issue like that, a mod in the subreddit will add flare to the topic that says 'misleading, false,  or whatever else.'

You have seen the light brother. You now stare through the bullshit with laser eyes. 
"That would be true if they didn't have to render everything under the gun anyway, which they do.

The gun here is rendered *after everything else* at a close distance to the near clip plane so it can't go behind any world geometry.

You're half right, though, in that the first person gun models are higher res and do take up a lot of screen real estate, so your eye is naturally drawn to them and doesn't notice the lower resolution world geometry as much.

But yeah, it doesn't ""cover up"" anything and allow them to not render it - it's not like you do occlusion based on where the first person gun is.

"Well... why don't more people try this? If 20 people report it using only 2GB of RAM, would you believe them?"
"They only matter to a certain degree. Like if a game has bad graphics and you can tell what the hell it what and its hindering gameplay then it matters. But if its shitty graphics but you can clearly see what's what then it doesn't matter. 

Also I don't like judging a book by its cover."
"I recently watched a play-through of BF 4 single-player, and just watched a video of the first 30 minutes of Cod ghost (single-player).

I was bored with BF 4's story line and was was impressed by CoD's story-line, although I've just seen 30 minutes.  

The part where you're fighting hord's of ""bad guys"" seemed pretty similar to BF 4's; You walk around a bit, get confronted by a bunch of baddies and kill em to death.

BF 4 single-player I watched; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FC3ve0c8oo

CoD single-player I watched; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCGydpJXIOg

(both from the same channel)

My point; I'm thinking CoD has invested heavily into the cut-scenes/story-line, where BF 4 focused on the multiplayer. "
"It's very unlikely that the CoD Devs didn't compress their textures. There is no real reason to not compress textures, as the quality loss is significantly small. Apart from that, uncompressed textures would eat up too much vram"
"I too am curious on why people are trying to defend this game. It's 2013 and their trying to give me 2008 graphics.

Ha glad someone said this. It is quite impressive how nice those graphics were in 2007/2008.

Yet there is this massive stupid backlash, sure there are some attention whores out there.  But it's not because they are a girl playing games, they are probably an attention seeker in every facet of their life.  I know the majority of you are decent people, and a bunch of you think this shit is as stupid as I think it is.  But please, don't drive the wedge between female and  male  gamers any more than it already is."
"Indeed, it's so horrible that developers are being **pressured** by *feminists* to developing games that keep such a /tiny/ number of people in mind. It's not like females were found to make up about 47% of all gamers in 2012.

Why should they get what they want? 

Sarcasm aside. This is dumb, guys. There have always been females playing video games, and the numbers climb every year.

Personally, I get offended when I'm being pandered to by devs with oversexualized men and women. It's hard to take an idea of developers including and changing these characters because I have a cock, and they think their product will sell better if they can convince me to think with it.

I'm not against sexuality as a device in gaming (sultry seductresses and assassins who use their sexuality as a weapon stand out for appropriate places), but there are characters that have no reason to be sexualized. 

An example of sexuality done right would have to be Catherine, although I hated the end, and the general mechanics left a lot to be desired, they did characters well.

Some good examples of sexuality done wrong is Never Dead (the boss is quite simply tits on a stick), and half the female champions in League of Legends (There is an Arctic themed champion, Sejuani, who is basically in a fur bikini).
______________
**Edit:** I've gotten a lot of questions on my source for the 47% statistic: [Here](http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/ESA_EF_2012.pdf) is my source. 

They got their information from NPD, a company based around finding consumer information for companies to utilize when planning future products. They use 2 million surveyors with varied demographics for one portion of their information gathering. The other portion is done directly from retailers, when applicable. 

I'd also like to address the most frequent argument that was given towards this: 

""These women only play casual games, because of this other statistic that says 33% of people play games on cell phones."" 

This is a flawed thought in multiple ways:

* Not all people who play ""casually"" are female. I play casual games. And while I play other games too,  I have a buddy that ONLY has time to play ""casual"", and he does so buses and such. Using the very small sample-size of my personal life isn't quite sound, but it gives reasonable doubt to the idea of ""all  ""casuals"" are female"".

* Not all iPhone games are strictly ""casual"", utilizing that vague concept of a time of game with limited mechanics and lacking story. Yes, there are a lot of shitty games for the iOS, but there are a lot of shitty games for the 360 and PC. Bad Rats. Those cheap hunting and shooter games that you find laying in a pile at a Dollar store, 3/4ths of the kinect line-up.  These are all crappy games. And to show a counter to this: Angry Birds sold really well on the 360, and I don't believe the idea that ""casual"" gamers would buy a 360 just for more Angry Birds. Good, entertaining iPhone games? Sword and Sworcery, the Capcom DS games that were ported over (Ghost Detective, etc.), Space Team. 

* As above shown by my own gaming habits, people can play multiple types of games.

Thank you all for the discussion, and I look forward to discussing this issue further!"

"Honestly, can't we all just shut the hell up about this shit already?

Video games are a market commodity. 

Girls/guys - don't want over sexualized characters? Don't buy those games and/or don't customize your character to look that way (in some cases, those customizations are tracked)

But it will never go away. Have films and TV eradicated shitty roles for girls or sexist plot arcs? Nope. 

There's going to be product available for wherever there is market demand.

Stop talking so much with your mouth, and talk more with your wallet. (I'm speaking to both genders and sides of the argument here).

Because everything you have to say is worthless unless it's a reflection of demand in the marketplace, in which case you probably don't have to say it. 

Finally, support indie games more. Because the major publishers take their cues quite frequently from trends in independent games, but don't take risks without precedent, so if kickass, dynamic, and non-sexualized characters do well there (i.e. Portal), you'll see more in the mainstream. I.e. your wallet speaks louder in independent marketplaces.

TL;DR: This conversation is pointless - the market will correct based on actual demand, as it has done for 20+ years. And if your wants and needs aren't reflected by the masses, welcome to the club (still waiting for a new Chrono Trigger or Mother 4 game)."

And after a while, she kinda just stopped playing games with me (I live in a house with 3 sisters and no brothers, so I really didn't have any other people to play with, as my neighborhood was pretty deserted at the time). I always wanted to play with her again.

But when Halo 3 came out, I played it night and day - Constantly. I didn't think she'd ever really get dedicated to playing again, so I came to terms with that. However, one day she asked if she could play with me, so I was more than happy to (Yay, friendship!) So we play Team Doubles as her first Matchmaking game (She didn't want to play with other/alot of people yet. The first game type to come? Team Snipers on Valhalla - which is basically Hell on Earth for a nooby. So when the match comes, we're getting DOMINATED - It's 30 kills to 10. I've been playing for a really long time, so I'm a pretty decent shot with the sniper. So the enemy team is always hanging back, and taking shots from the bushes/trees, and we don't see them until it's too late. (I stay close to my sister, because I have to help her out with the basics -which in turn, gets us both killed)

So I realized something - If we wanted to win, we'd have to be creative. Thus began Operation: ""Retard Magnet"". I'd have her sprint out into the open field in the most drunkard way possible, zig-zagging, ducking, jumping, ext. The enemies would see her, and try to shoot her, but they couldn't predict where she was moving! I sat back and took them out as quick as I could. We kept that up for the remainder of the match, and we won 36-50. They barely got any kills after she ran out. So we were hysterically happy and laughing after that. That got her addicted to gaming again for a little while before she moved out :)"
"Why the hell does this have do many upvotes?

I have lost faith in humanity."
"It's backwards to me. I enjoyed a lot of NES games and I'd like to play on my husbands Xbox but there aren't many games that appeal to me.  I'd like to do more cartoon-styled games like Mario than something realistic with shooting. It seems like everything is shooting, sports or racing. Which is fine for those who like it; it's just not my thing. "
"I remember a time when some of my friends thought I was a loser for playing videogames, let alone girls. I think N64 changed that quite a bit. "
"This is not one of those cases.  I was raised around both guy and girl gamers, so the notion that girls haven't played video games until now is goddamned ignorant to me.

Actually, this whole thing is just miserable.  It's not even funny.

Also, fuck off for making anyone feel bad for liking something you like."

"They didn't get it right. Complaints about the appalling portrayal of women in games have existed for many years. I remember old *Micromanía* magazines from the 90s with Tomb Raider 2 reviews commenting the obvious, embarrassing pandering Lara's body was.

What happens is it has become gradually less okay to simply shrug off this issue. These kinds of complaints don't fall on deaf ears anymore, and I'm glad."
"As a girl who plays the occasional game, not going to call myself a gamer. In elementary school I was made fun of for writing a poem about video games (It was about Final Fantasy 5), I became the class loser. Back in the early 90's playing video games was for 'losers' now it's like the normal thing to do, kids now don't even know how to build a tree fort! >_< I built one, it was my Batcave. Aw crap now that I think about it I was a loser... -Harsh realization of reality. "
This is ridiculous and it's embarrassing that you thought this was an astute observation. I'll bet you got so excited when you read this piece of stupidity that your bladder spasms could have extinguished a small housefire.
"The thing is girls played games as long as anyone has. Just the ones who scream that they're a girl gamer (which is almost every girl who makes it to the front page) are posers.

4chan usually gets it right. They're just awful at showcasing it.

plenty of people generalize all guys who play video games as neckbeard losers.  Just ignore it and move on.
"> people who only care about shooting n00bs, giggling at digital breasts and ploughing hours into perfecting loadouts.

Can I ask why you included the last one? The first two are great examples of childish behaviour, but what's so wrong about caring enough to spend time on a game?

There's a difference between not wanting to be associated with the asshats of gaming whose outward attitude (and the resulting games which cater to said attitudes) ruin it for those around them, and resenting games which require (or even just allow for) more than a casual, passing interest. The former is fair, and even beneficial imo, but to me the latter seems needlessly resentful.

Perhaps I'm reading too much in to a single comment, but it just seemed like a really odd inclusion in a post which I otherwise agree with.

>So, more games aimed at the stereotyped 'female gamer' can only be a good thing, if only because I can buy them too.

But the thing is, games aimed at this stereotype don't manifest in the way you've described. They differ in subject matter primarily.

""Girl's games"" are things like Animal Crossing. They're not ""boy's games"" with the approach changed. Girls who just want to play games, rather than ""girl's games"" are just left with a smaller pool of games which appeal to their sensibilities. Not a non-existent pool as some would have you believe, and it's certainly a situation which is improving (the image of scantily clad, buxom female characters is far from dead, but not as ubiquitous as it once was, and actually western gaming is doing better at getting rid of it than, say, the Japanese fighter market), but I can still see their point."
"This. On reddit of all places. I thought most of us had our shit together. I guess not. My sister played SNES with me a lot, we loved playing games together. Fuck this sexist post."
"Games were always cool man. You don't build up a business from litterally nothing and make it into a multi-billion dollar industry before you run it into the ground and threaten to bury the corpse before you go and build it up again, all in a decade without something about it being cool."
"I feel like you could fill this entire thing out for guys, replacing the 'only nerds play video games' with 'All girls are stuck-up whores who think I'm a geek for playing video games, fucking cunts.' and then 'Why do these fucking whores think my attitude is sexist?'"
"Yeah I'm thinking the age of the person making this image matters a lot. You've got two things obscuring real data here: 

1) someone born after 1979 matured WITH videogames and thus won't be able to separate their coolness from videogames' social coolness from their social group's maturity, and then: 

2) between 1995 and 2005 the Internet went from something only nerds and adults used to something EVERYONE uses, meaning suddenly it's way more likely that you'll notice your classmate playing games or complaining about guys on Facebook. Before this, you would've had to actually TALK to her to discover this info, instead of our current state of perpetual eavesdropping.

So I'd be very interested what 10 year olds, 20, 30, and 40 year olds each think about the history of women and videogames. Even before videogames, what about board games and D&D? I'm sure the stereotypes of male nerds being antisocial and prejudiced didn't come about overnight. Personally, I love when my female friends invite everyone to board game / Wii / rockband nights, and have great fun playing split screen or controller swap with them; I'm glad that we share hobbies and sad that it's become (perhaps necessarily) politicized.

You might even be able to go straight back to the 1870's with the attitudes surrounding cards, dice, jacks, etc. I seem to recall Huck Finn didn't interact very well with the ladies...

Time to go back to college and write a sociology thesis? "
"Now with an extra dash of ""There's no sexism in gaming, and anyone who says otherwise is a whiny bitch or a white knight!"""
">Who is saying these things?

The projection of women that 4chan/Reddit uses in order to justify their hatred for them."
"IMO, sexism in videogames is a reflection of sexism in society. Movies, music, comics ...most of the media is sexist. That doesn't mean that videogames should be sexist, and it's okay to complain, but have that in mind, it's not only videogames. (And that's a big part of the problem)
"
">It's not like females were found to make up about 47% of all gamers in 2012.

Let me guess, the study that found that number counted farmville and words with friends as a game.

>**There have always been females playing video games**, and the numbers climb every year.

No one is denying that there's always been women who play videogames, but at about the time videogames just started hitting the mainstream and even before that women were a stark minority, it just didn't appeal to most women.


>>There have always been females playing video games, **and the numbers climb every year.**

There was also a time where most gamers weren't adults and were just kids and teenagers, but its no coincidence the number of female gamers increases as video gaming has become steadily more popular.

>Personally, I get offended when I'm being pandered to by devs with oversexualized men and women. It's hard to take an idea of developers including and changing these characters because I have a cock, and they think their product will sell better if they can convince me to think with it.

Good for you?

Videogames are meant to be entertaining, sex is damn entertaining, most of human history can attest to that.

>Some good examples of sexuality done wrong is Never Dead (the boss is quite simply tits on a stick), and half the female champions in League of Legends (There is an Arctic themed champion, Sejuani, who is basically in a fur bikini).

And surprise surprise most of the fans of that genre tend to be male.

It doesn't help thats probably the most competitive genre and so because of that often finds itself under fire by people looking for reason to bitch and whine.

"
"My wife and I spent a few days in college getting to know each other by reminiscing about Sega and playing Toejam and Earl 2. She may not be a hardcore competitive LoLer, but she is a major reason my Skyrim playtime is over 400 hours, we beat all of the bosses in Terraria while she was pregnant, she got the Platinum trophy on whatever Katamari game was on PS3, and she was the one who pulled the trigger on Saints Row 3. 

Also, my sister and I constantly fought over who got to play the NES unless we has 2 player games. We both got first gen gameboys, constantly compared Tetris scores, then we got deep into some Pokemon. I got blue, she got red, and we traded all of the color-exclusives so we cold both get 150. We dueled with other neighborhood kids and she stomped some local boys mercilessly. 

The girl gamer has always existed. There are definitely trend-chasers who are kinda phony, but that's a definite minority."
"For female characters to be as interesting as male characters instead of being defined by their sexuality or sub-servitude to a male character.  

Sexuality as a plot/character device is fine when done correctly, but the degree to which female characters are just tits on a vapid frame in many games is embarrassing. I know where to go to get tits if I want, I don't need it constantly injected into every game I see. "
"Only a moron thinks that in anyway advertising your gender is pandering for attention.  The only reason you guys think that saying you're a girl is in anyway a problem is that you have a fucking weird, creepy attitude to women.  We are not the ones with the problem for having feminine gamer tags!  Grow the hell up."
"Ive been playing since I could hold a controller pretty much. First experience was on our SNES. Always been a gamer girl and I get vocal to the people who try to put me down. I just dont get the reason for the double standard, why cant we all just enjoy games and not hate on people who either dislike whatever game we like or hate on people who dont like whatever game it is as much as we do.  The gaming community as a whole needs to stand united against the people on the outside who want to shut video games down all together, and quit putting down individuals in that community."
But the problem is that not everyone's wallet is the same size.
"Yes, the most progressive steps in the world have been made when people just ""shut the hell up about [that] shit already"".

On a non-sarcastic note: The industry caters to the attitudes of the gamers. Conversations with the gamers that are in the community right now are essential to changing the tide of how sexism is seen in video games. Many things that are based in sexism, racism, homophobia, etc. nowadays are based in a cultural issue, they can't be legislated or forced away, the changes have to come from the ground up."
"So why is there no backlash when a guy says ""I'm a gamer and I made this gamer cake for my gamer girlfriend""?  Cause I've seen those posts, and there is zero backlash.  

Maybe - just MAYBE - these ""posers"" are trying so hard because of how hard it is to be socially accepted by a community that so frequently mocks and trivializes women.  Is Fake Nerd Girl annoying? Yeah.  But she's fucking rare.  And the assumption that all nerdy girls are Fake Nerd Girls is the problem."
"Whenever I'm told that, I consider it a win. SRS is only scary to racists, sexists, and man-children."
">The hatred of women.

>~~The~~My hatred of women.

God, that looks harsh of me. But what I'm saying isn't that you hate women, it's that your taking your viewpoint and dismissing all the hatred in gaming with it. You can't speak for all of the gamers who get furiously vitriolic about female gamers, and the fact that you have a specific justification doesn't make the OTT sexism fine or normal. This comment's you, it's not all of gaming culture."
">I count it as my greatest accomplishment on this site that I stirred up so much butthurt with four sentences, all of which are stated diplomatically and are completely true.

"Yes, let's take the ramblings of a bunch of sociopathic 14 year old basement-dwelling boys/ 20 year old man-children as some kind of great social truth.

Wanna know why they say gaming is for losers? This shit right here. This is some loser-ass shit.

Also, the whole videogames must cater to our needs shit. Fucking christ, it's not like gamers are the most entitled little shits ever when it comes to their media of choice or anything. WAH CALL O DOOTY BAHD I DUN LEIK RUN N GUN. WAH, THEY CHANGED DANTE IN DEVIL MAY CRY NOW ITS LITERALLY THE WORST THING EVER SERIES IS DEAD WHY HAVE THEY FORSAKEN US FANS. WAH DIABLO 3 CHANGED, APPEASE ME. ""Hardcore"" gaming culture is a fucking CESSPIT of entitlement and a bunch of nerdy maladjusted misogynists want to point it out in almost half the fucking population of earth?

So basically flipping the fuck out when a class gets some skills and stats a tiny bit nerfed/buffed in a sequel/patch isn't entitlement, but not wanting to be harassed with harmful stereotypes and predatorial bullshit is?

Do the world a favor and shut your fucking mouth until you learn what perspective is."

">So I'd be very interested what 10 year olds, 20, 30, and 40 year olds each think about the history of women and videogames.

Mid-thirties here. Grew up with an Atari, moved on to NES in 86, pretty much got a new console every four or so years after that. 

I played video games with all of my neighbors, half of whom were girls. Played video games with my best friend, also a girl, up until we grew apart (beat Dragon Quest together). Was the only girl in a four-person Nintendo club in 1989. Wrote articles (poor ones!) about video games for the high school news paper. Currently own every modern system (and handheld) aside from WiiU. 

I've known girls who play games all my life. I'm sure there are less of us than guys, but we're here. Always have been. And if guys can't accept that then I don't want to play with them.

I never ever thought that there was this gender bracket of gamers until I started reading Reddit and 4chan. I never came across anyone who had any kind of issue or surprise or any adverse reaction to me being a girl who plays games. I never even knew this kind of thing was an issue. I've just always played them, with friends, and didn't give a fuck.

Now granted, I don't play online VS. games like CoD, because I don't like shooters. So I guess I'm kind of sheltered? It really shocks me to know that girls get picked on that much, but knowing what these idiot kids are saying to even other dudes it doesn't surprise me much. I think they're just idiots, not really sexist, just trying to grasp at the easiest thing to insult a person with.

As far as the influx of girl gamers and gaming becoming ""cool""? I don't really care either. I'm glad more girls are playing games here. Maybe they'll make some more female-oriented games that don't have to do with raising animals or playing dress-up. And as far as the ""girls are posers and don't play games"" thing? Fuck those guys. I don't let it bother me. I feel like the people who do are just insecure. I know who I am and what I like to do. 

Posts like these make me laugh, because I just feel like these people are really sheltered and wrapped up in their own heads. Real life doesn't really work like this outside of high school, but if they want to keep believing it is, then go right ahead. Not gonna take any skin off my back, but I am going to laugh at the people who become outraged at it. "
"That was a very thorough answer! I was born in '77. When video games (Atari/NES) hit mainstream, I don't remember them being associated with nerdiness. Of course, the girls didn't play them as much, but they didn't play with Transformers or HeMan, either. Fast forward to high school - it seemed like *everything* that wasn't 100% ""badass"" was nerdy. I always attributed this to us (my freinds/schoolmates) being mullet bearing douche-bags in the early 90s, though."
"Ironically while saying 'this is how *all women have acted towards gaming*'. These people are fucking idiots, for sure. Hey, you, reading this, now. Do you think this linked image makes an argument which is anything other than *fucking stupid*? Yes? You're an idiot."
So all female gamers are hideously ugly? because I remember the plain ones (I never cared for the popular bitches) and none of them were gamers either. They were just as bitchy and reacted the same way as the popular ones.
"This is bullshit.

"A lot of the people who call out sexism in video games call it out in society, including all the media you mention (look at the Bechdel test website, for example). Unfortunately so many people take it personally when people have started to call out video games that they take it to mean video games are under attack. When I'd just like media in general to not be sexist."
"So, someone who played Super Mario in 1987 was not on the same league of gamer as someone who played Contra? NAMCO baseball player wasn't to even speak with a Battletoadian?

There have always been casual gamers. I remember my aunt always beating my ass at Tetris. Nowadays, you ""hardcore"" gamers would spit in her face for being a stupid casual.

The truth is that these are games, and that person is a gamer. I'm sorry that it's no longer such an elite group of the patchiest overweight neckbeards on the planet, but there were always casual games and always hardcore games. My ex would sit in her room with friends and play Sonic every day growing up. She got older and would rather play Farmville or angry birds because they were much more relaxed and fun.

I think more girls played video games when they were young than you remember. I honestly don't know any girls who are in their 20's that act like the girls that 4Chan seems to hate so much. That really just seems like stupid high school kids trying to fit in with other stupid high school kids and talk to boys. Just like a lot of guys who pretend to be interested in art and music in order to talk to girls.

But you know, fuck them for trying to become interested in your hobbies. Little posts like this will teach them to ever try and have sex with guys who play video games."
"Me and my sister used to settle disputes by playing burnout or super smash bros, fought over who got to play their zelda game next and nearly killed each other when save files were ""accidentally"" deleted.

Edit- I appear to have Rustled SRS's jimmies a bit. Eh, whatever."
"I replied to someone else, but you're asking the question. http://www.feministfrequency.com/ That's the website.Anita wanted to take a look at the depiction of women in video games. Basically, she got 150 grand, so the project is going to be far larger than just a few youtube videos, so the release date got pushed back, which lead to a bunch of people claiming she ""ran off with the money"".  Also, there were death threats because when you are wanting your pass time to be considered an art form, and someone comes along and actually treats it critically as such, it's serious business."
"Pretty much. I like to think my view on it was pretty unbiased. At least, compared to the articles on it, which I feel are all pretty one-sided.

More or less, she had a show on YouTube where she pointed out sexist tropes in stuff. She wanted to get into doing Games, but apparently this required several thousand dollars to start doing. She claims she needed it for the games themselves and to pay expenses while playing them. I'd judge, based on her entire lack of games, that she probably wouldn't self-identify as a gamer. She had a list of many major titles for consoles that she wanted to purchase.

After that, most people heard about her campaign because she was allegedly threatened. According to her, several people threatened her for saying games are sexist by sending her comments about how women are terrible. I don't believe she ever released the comments, supposedly e-mailed to her. She simply alluded to them being offensive and menacing. I'm fairly suspicious about whether or not she actually received many angry comments, how menacing they were, etc.

Basically, the thing blew up. A ton of people donated and rushed to her defense. Plenty of people wrote articles about how it was proof games were sexist and gamers treated women poorly, making her videos more necessary and encouraging more donations. The campaign blew up and everyone started feeling like gamers were sexist and misogynistic.

If you want my opinion, the entire thing just made the whole ""girl gamers"" issue worse by raising tensions and making people take polarizing sides. Anyone not saying sexism is prominent in gaming communities is called a sexist, and anyone saying it is will be considered a fanatic and not a real gamer. Things were getting better, and now almost everyone is on some kind of side on this issue and trying to paint the opposing side as monsters.

As far as I know, she hasn't delivered on the videos she promised, and has pretty much just disappeared with the money."
"Ms Sarkesian. It's not just that, it's that she also pretty much said she was a major person in the feminist community. Many bits of the Feminist Community promply went 'Fucking What' and started to bitch at her. And then several people went full retard and ALSO threatoned to do horrible shit to her, vindicating her in the eyes of many.

Honestly, the day she fades from view is a good one...she is NOT a good person, and if not for those idiots nobody would care about her. Alas, those which set out to destroy her managed to give her the power she needed to make people idolize her...and here we are."
"Nobody want's to be called by the wrong pronouns all the time. If you don't say you are a girl, there are just too many comments coming at you like, thx bro, dude, man, it's irritating. You don't want to be called ma'am all day every day. letting someone know the correct pronouns to use isn't demanding special treatment."
"Because every girl should just allow people to assume they're a man, right?

My gender is a part of my life. It's a part of who I am. A man, defined as the default in our culture, may not see his gender in the same way, as he will most likely (unless he acts ""abnormal"") be assumed to be a man no matter what. Women are also assumed to be men, unless they specifically point out that they are not. And then they are told they deserve sexist shit thrown at them day in and day out.

When you tell women not to mention that they're women, you are telling them to hide their gender. Instead of, you know, telling men (and women! there's a huge problem of ""boy's club"" women in gaming) not to be sexist shits when a gender is mentioned."
"If you don't say you're a guy, everyone assumes you are.  You do not know what this problem is.  I'm a girl!  It's not an issue.  But I play L4D, I do realism mode, I need a mic.  I have a girlvoice.  What'm I supposed to fucking do, use a synthesizer?  Because I'm tired of people being weird about it.  Gamers need to grow the fuck up and get out of the damn bubble, or let some other people in, because that segregated community is turning the nations teenage boys into total fucktards."
Exactly- like how gay people should just stay in the closet if they don't want to deal with homophobia and women in the middle east should keep with the burqa thing if they want to avoid rape. It's best to hide the factors that our detractors disprove of rather than try to dispel prejudice by confronting them.  
"Somehow this reminds me of Don't Ask Don't Tell.  To paraphrase: ""well if you didn't *say* that you were a girl people wouldn't treat you like shit!  So really, it's your fault."" >.<"
"""The hatred of women"" in the gaming industry is a delusion. A delusion that is largely projected by extremists or people on the outside looking in.  Men in gaming do not hate women, nor do they hate women who legitimately share in their particular passion. There are far more men in gaming trying to include and seek out female gamers then there are women doing the same for men. If anything, male gamers are desperate to actually find more women who game and misandry, as well as women excluding themselves from, insulting or belittling male gamers, is far more common place.  There is nothing misogynistic about male developers creating content that reflect their own personal fantasies, desires and preferences. 

 There is nothing misogonystic about heterosexual men being attracted to, or appealed by, sexualized female characters(calling their interest misogynistic is nothing more than sheer heterophobia).  There is nothing misogynistic about women being hazed in the same manner men haze each other in a competitive environment(giving women special preferential treatment, as is often expected from women despite the misandric implications, would be a better example of sexism).  There is nothing misogynistic with men(or women) calling out certain women for abusing their gender, sex appeal or scarcity to manipulate other men(who are already in a  desperate/vulnerable enough position because of the sexual/romantic position they are in as a result of misandric cultural factors against gaming and male gamers). There is nothing misogynistic with calling out women who call themselves gamers despite not having any real interest, appreciation or passion towards gaming, supporting the industry or the men within it who have, so far, made it what it is.

  The problem with the gaming industry is not misogyny, the music industry is far more misogynistic than the gaming industry could ever hope to be and yet it is consumed, supported and propelled by countless women. The problem with the gaming industry is, and has always been, misandry.  Hate, disdain and narcissism, primarily from women, towards male interests, towards the meek(or non-physically intensive pass time), towards gaming as a medium and towards male gamers. "

"So when Atari and NES came out, did you see any girls play them? 

I know when I was 7 I played NES with the neighbor girl, but then again I stopped getting invited over because I was treating their house like an arcade and played her NES without her a few times :p so my first anecdotal evidence is that playing videogames with girls was fun, but they didn't like them as much as I did for whatever reason. (Guy friends would hardly ever turn down an opportunity to play videogames.)

Girls after that never seemed interested in games; I hung out with nerdy girls, but they preferred books and dancing and other stuff. I was one of the few ""computer"" people growing up. The cool kids had N64s and stuff, but they wouldn't even say hi to me. I'm sure videogames took a backseat to basketball for them."
"I guess you talked to the wrong girls. I've always dated nerds, my high school ex taught me how to play D&D, my husband and I prefer to spend our Friday nights playing games and watching movies together."
I wish we had more accurate statistics on gamers and their gender. All we have right now are statistics that include every mobile game on the market so we don't have any real statistics that encompass the culture of gaming/serious gamers/whatever the label is.
There's nothing wrong with sharing your experiences as long as you understand that they are nearly worthless for establishing larger trends and you don't imply otherwise.
"I was the big sister. I was the only reason my little brother even new Ninja Turtles existed. I was 6, playing the arcade game with the boys. Then my mom gets my little brother pretty much every tmnt toy on the market that christmas. Like a ton of action figures and the van. I got one turtle and some generic country Barbie. I liked Barbie, too. . . But this was one of those lame Barbies. I was so livid that year. My dad said it was cuz the tmnt was more boy toys, but then I should have been given a barbie dream house or something to compensate. As you can see, I an still a little bitter. 

When we got the NES, it was a family system. Everyone played. Sadly, I sucked ass at most games. Really bad hand eye coordination when I was younger. Very frustrating. My little bro was great south the mechanics, but would easily get stuck and not know what to do next. So we tag teamed. He was my hands. It also got to where he hated playing without me. He had serious gamer rage, like controller throwing. He needed the second pair of eyes for boss fights and such. "
"Holy anecdata, Batman!

"Well in all fairness, there is really only 1 side TO it.  She kickstartered for cash for videogames.  Got videogames, and likely pocketed the rest of the cash.

Her plan is to do intensive research on women in videogames or some shit.

In reality, it's been done by men and women at least 1000 times already, AND they did it for free, with their own money, AND they did it WELL.

In the meantime, this girl has done almost nothing, has barely reported anything she's done, and doesn't reply to any requests for status updates.

She's a liar, a hack, and a user.

"I didn't really follow this as it happened, so this isn't a loaded question; has she kept the donators (or the public in general) updated with what she is doing with the extra money and when she aims to deliver some content (whatever that content wil be)?"
She did release the comments. Most of them contained treats to rape and kill her. She did a video series and set up a program where educators can download a free curriculum to talk to people about this. She did a TEDwomen seminar about this. Here is the link to the video where she talks about her experiences. http://tedxwomen.org/speakers/anita-sarkeesian-2/

1. Woman on the internet

2. Woman played/wanted to play/mentioned games

3. Woman said games were sexist

An iffy 4. Woman of Jewishness 


I also don't think most people have taken a side. I think the really vocal, need to have an enemy/portion of the population to hate have taken a side. Most people probably feel that of course games can be sexist but not all are, there is nothing wrong with female gamers and xbox live is a cesspit for everyone apart from white, 14 year old american sounding boys. 

I think most people are having a good time playing decent games. 

Edit: My post may look like I'm trying to argue against you. I'm not, I found your post really decent. Just adding to the discussion and would rather just make one post here :)"

">she hasn't delivered on the videos she promised, and has pretty much just disappeared with the money.

This is the biggest issue I and many others have with this.  She says she wants to talk about how games are sexist, but doesn't actually play games so she asks for a buncha money to buy them and make dinky youtube videos of her talking head.  Then she doesn't even deliver, pushes the deadline back by months and more months and yet more months, and remains completely uncommunicative on her progress.  Oh, and she ended up asking for her backers to send in examples of sexism they observed in games.  She asked her backers to do her paid research for her.

One side comes off as hateful but let's not forget who's shaping up to be the scammer here.

No woman can be a thing you consider 'masculine' such as gamers, soldiers and etc because of this bullshit narrative you preach where only *women* ""want"" attention. Specifically that of geeks.

It's a really fucking pathetic mindset. 'Women are out to get me/get something from me' isn't 'People are obnoxious'."
"everyone understands that there are shitty people of all stripes.  this guy never said ""man, sometimes people suck.""  he was specifying women, in particular.  the ""everybody sucks sometimes"" thin is not an excuse for that, being as he was talking about a specific subgroup of people.  it's pretty simple stuff."
"I was definitely not cool in elementary school or middle school, but I did have a few friends. In high school I was totally an outcast punk kid and none of us were popular but we did have a really tight circle of friends as well. 

I don't think I had any ""nerd"" close friends, because well we didn't have a lot of them in school. The ""nerdy"" people were actually kind of cool, but again since we were all trying to be punk rockers no one liked us. 

Um 95 I played Golden Eye, Panzer Dragoon, Nights, a lot on the saturn. I also replayed a lot of Nintendo games. I kind of stopped for about two years because I was too busy socializing and playing sports, but in 97 I picked back up again big time with Street Fighter, FFVII, Tactics, Saiyuki, Puzzle Fighter, Parappa, pretty much played a lot of those kinds of games through college. Took up Ultima ONline for a brief period. Played tons of Katamari and even FFXI (oh god why). I mean even in FFXI there wasn't a stigma around girl gamers, we were all really respected people in the community and there were tons of us (well that and tons of guys posing as girls). 

I quit ffxi when I was 25 and I'm really picky about what I play now, but my husband and I play a lot of games and we have lots of friends, guys and girls, that do. I just don't get what the big hooplah is about.

Oh, and here's a funny thing, I don't even really LIKE Zelda. I played the first and second and stopped there. I tried playing the other ones but I'm not a fan. Imagine that, a girl gamer who doesn't like Zelda games. Hm.

She provides regular updates to her backers, those of us who did throw a few bucks in get to hear about what's up.

Additionally, the other researchers didn't do it with their own money. They did it with grants they got from wherever. So again in that case, a concerned party or academic institution paid money for it. And they did it in a strictly academic way. She's doing it in a more popularly accessible way that can be more easily spread about.

Those of us who did back the project? We knew what we were getting into. We were backing someone who was going to work on a project that's going to take a LONG time. It doesn't help that every time she does stick her neck out, scared, angry little boys attack her from every direction. Probably makes it hard to get work done. Even her twitter account has gone mostly silent except for a post every few days.

We're patient. Whatever comes out of it, with whatever result, is going to be interesting. If the research is shitty then? Then go ahead and get angry. She's not trying to ruin games, or ruin your fun."

She regularly updates to actual backers of the project, and the project was pushed back in order to make it fitting of the donations that various people willingly made."

">Its a scam

I am going to stop you right there. Holy shit, if you want people to start taking you seriously, stop writing garbage like this."
"The small company I manage has been developing with OpenGL ES 2.0 on the Android platform for the last two years.  Prior to that myself and other folks here worked on five Call of Duty games, three Rock Band titles, Wolfenstein, Bomberman, Heretic II, Halo 2, and others.  I have a ton of experience with exactly this platform and console titles in general.

1) Power Management

This is basically irrelevant here, for a couple reasons.  Firstly is that this is a plugged in device and battery life isn't an issue.  Second is that this device is using a Tegra3, and even when it's running flat-out the power usage of a Tegra device is a tiny fraction of that a PS3 or a 360 uses.  That said, I suspect you're just using your terminology wrong.

The impression I get is that you're talking about Android's prioritization, meaning you think the OS is going to be using a bunch of CPU time in the background, thus taking it away from the game.  Compared to a 360 this may be true, but my experience so far is that it's not a meaningful issue, certainly not any more than a Windows title.  The foreground process gets plenty of priority on Android, and if anything this device would have a lot of the usual background cruft stripped out as it doesn't need to deal with telephony or widgets or anything.

2) Games

This console is NOT a beast compared to the Xbox360 or PS3, at least not in the CPU department (8 gig of ram is pretty spectacular, actually).  However, you are underselling the performance of the Tegra3.  Looking at the raw numbers it's comparable in speed to what you'd get out of an XBox 360, and it will absolutely spank a Wii.

The biggest issues here (compared to a 360) aren't actually due to the chipset so much as the fact it'll likely be using OpenGL ES, which is missing some very useful functionality (such as the ability to scale a lower-res buffer inexpensively to screen res).  There are some nVidia specific extensions that can help ameliorate these issues however, and due to the fact a game for this platform can count on them being there they'll probably even be worth supporting.

Things like this matter because the Tegra3's fillrate is pretty much the same as on the 360, a device that struggles to run well at 1080p.  If you can't upscale cheaply that's going to make adequate performance at that resolution fairly difficult.  I view this as the device's biggest problem given customer expectation.

Your point about making something like Uncharted is just naive.  The hardware here is not night and day different, speed wise, to a PS3 or 360.  You could definitely make something comparable on this device from a technical standpoint, just like you could on a Tegra3 based tablet (though you'd be taking a big risk, since you can't count on the hardware being there yet).  Regardless, the big thing is the art -- it would cost twenty million dollars in development to match Uncharted's production quality, but that isn't the hardware's problem.

3) Emulation

Most people, and I use 'most' as a severe understatement, do not have a PC attached to their television, and so far as I can tell don't want one.  The fact a PC can do the same things doesn't really seem like the point here.  Whatever floats your boat, though.

4) Your Device Already Does it

This is a completely valid point and is basically the same as my attitude towards the device -- it's interesting, and I'd consider developing for it, but I'd have to see something more compelling to take the risk of making something exclusive for it.  If one of those guys sent me an e-mail saying they'd pay for development then sure, but independently and self-funded I'd be hedging my bets all over the place.  The biggest risk of this thing is that it's not coming from a major player, and that hasn't worked well historically in this segment.  Random dude at Wal-Mart will mostly ignore it.

Still, I can think of worse things than an inexpensive, reasonably easy to support device that allows you to play Android titles in a proper living room environment without dealing with the somewhat-touchy-in-my-experience HDMI/bluetooth support of whatever tablet you own."
"In my opinion, the product they're selling is worth $99. If you don't like it, don't buy it, but don't go around shouting accusations of it being a scam."
"What a ridiculously hyperbolic post. All the hate is uncalled for.

The OUYA is not a scam, it's a device that caters to a lightly populated niche. Of course your computer can do anything that it can do - that's not the point. Otherwise, things like Roku and Apple TV wouldn't exist. 

The point is that this is an inexpensive box that will have a dedicated link to your TV or entertainment system, and it will give you access to all kinds of games (and other Android features) without the restrictions normally put in place by console-makers. The hardware will not be up to par with those consoles, but again, that's not what it's meant for.

At its price point it seems like it could be an useful little thing, and if it turns out not to be it will die. Worth a try though."
"It's not a scam, it's just not what *you* want.  It isn't a match for a PS3 or Xbox, and it doesn't claim to be.  It's a F2P/emulation/media box.  Yes, plenty of devices can already do what it does.  But this is a device specifically designed for a living room and is pretty damn cheap considering every game on it is required to have a F2P portion.  That means that all you are paying for is the console itself, nothing else."
"hey, guess what, some people want an open source, $99 hackable machine to tinker with. What next, the raspberry pi is a fucking scam? Fuck you"
"There is so much hate in this post that it's just insulting to the end goal the OUYA is trying to create here.

Think of it this way. When I saw the kickstarter video, the one thing that struck in their end goal was to bring more people together in front of the TV to play an open-source console game. Of course the hardware wasn't going to be top notch, but it's to be expected.

Think of the long run in all of this. Since Android is a very accessible platform to develop on, game devs can design games with more interactive multiplayer support for TV console based systems, opening the market to casual players who may not really understand all the underlying ways to try and run emulators. It opens the market of open-source games to the casual console market, in which recent times, feel shafted for some of the limitations going on in the console world, what with all the DRM going on and the decline of the console age from what it used to be (Kinect anyone. Usher in E3?)

Even with hardware that feels a bit limited, there are ways to design with those limitations. Have people all lost hope, that because you don't have good hardware that great games can't be developed for the system?

OUYA can be a trend setter here, the price is well worth it for bringing more casual friendly gaming into the market. Yes there are issues like hacking and whatnot, but for its end goal, it's pretty promising. Don't think that the games it has now will be the only things there.

**TL:DR** - OUYA's end goal to broaden open-source gaming from the developers to the casual console market, who could very well not know how to utilize their PC to emulate themselves (too much hassle) at an inexpensive price is very promising, albet some issues, and devs can develop easy for the system to fight the sort of decline the console market is going through right now. Give it a chance."
"Mr. Hubbell, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."
"I don't see it as a rip off at all. It's only $99 dollars ffs, the xbox 360 cost $299 when it first came out for the bare system. I can hook my Samsung Galaxy II to my tv with the hdmi adapter I know, but this is a gaming console first and andriod device second and that's worth $99 to me. 

Personally I'll be waiting eagerly for the mame, nesdroid and multiple other emulators to become compatable with it so I can start playing the classics with a real controller again instead of my cramped touch screen. Plus if it does run android then I can watch movies and youtube on it too, there's lot of potential uses for this besides gaming.

Also about the lack of AAA titles, who gives a fuck really. AAA titles aren't going anywhere and it's not a requirement that gamers have to only play AAA titles or own only one console. That's like telling movie goers that they can only watch Micheal Bay's shitty transformer films at a mega plex and all other movies and theaters suck ass because they don't use hyperealistic cgi graphics and instead try to tell an actual story.  or god forbid those indie film makers always trying something to push the medium. "
It's not a scam just because you don't happen to like it. It's not trying to compete with PS3 or Xbox 360. And 99 bucks is a really good price for that hardware. I mean a just a PS3 controller is $50.
"Your point about not having power close to the Wii is ridiculous.

Shadowgun and Dead Trigger and Infinity Blade look better than the Wii, right now, on the iPad 3 (which has a resolution at least three times 
larger than the Wii).

These games (Infinity Blade excepting, but it could) all run on Android as well, and both Shadowgun and Dead Trigger are showcased in the trailer. Shadowgun looks as good as an Xbox 360 launch title and the Ouya will probably run in either 720p or 1080p native."
"I see a lot of cynical users not really understanding the approach Ouya is taking. It's the Snapple approach.. Wii didn't try to go head on with XBOX360 or PS3 because it knew it would lose so it became content with being #3. This to the next level of that type of strategy as far as I can see it. This allows smaller studios or even big studios to experiment with innovative ideas that even if they fall flat it's still a lower risk of loss than doing it on the XBOX or PS3.

We are entering era with gaming similar to 90s indie film movement with the help of New Line Cinema and Miramax Films. In this particular case the indie gaming space has already has had their own TMNT with Angry Birds, allowing this console to just be a place to go develop games cheaply, while acknowledging no AAA or AA titles. And using Angry Bird as an example is bad considering the HUGE FUCKING SUCCESS IT IS! It's like the is no different than what Hollywood does now. You have your summer blockbusters (Transformers), more serious or interesting movies (Fargo comes to mind) and True indie studios just making the games THEY want (think of Clerks).

There is no real downside to this and this is something that is really needed in the gaming industry. Only real people bitching about this are ""THE PC MASTER RACE!""

And they aren't the market this is meant to target. When people, aka the masses, think video games; they don't think of the PC. They think XBOX, Wii, Playstation. Power PC users are right that PCs can already do this but those aren't the average user. If the average user was competent then Best Buy would be able to pull horseshit like this: http://imgur.com/fMJhA

The idea of having to install a service like steam, installing a game by going to a site to download it or inserting discs can be VERY intimidating to some because most people don't use their system to JUST game. They have photos, documents, taxes, records, etc and having to do something that you may not know how to do is scary to some. I know, it's not rocket science but neither is changing your car's oil but Jiffy Lube exists. that's what this is, and it's not necessarily a bad thing.

I found another Reddit post titled: ""Should I tell her that there are easier ways to rotate PDF files?"" it links to this image: http://imgur.com/otK2E

Fact of the matter is if this fails, the people who are supporting this will be no different than early Atari Jaguar Owners, Sega 32X buyers and Nintendo Virtual Boy adopters. It's not a scam, they put it out there and the public has spoken in terms of what they want to see, myself included. I on the other hand have a wait an see approach, I see potential, they have reached their goal without my help and I expect this to usher in a new era showing off games to people that otherwise wouldn't see it. 

 If you feel it's a scam, then don't put money into it. The idea is sound and keep in mind every feature added to phones were met with same resistance. Camera, Video, games, internet, Messaging are all done a device that is ultimately is supposed to just to make a fucking phone call. So lets not act like we are above being wrong about an idea that maybe good because we may not see it's merits immediately.

TLDR: Let it happen! It's not your money to worry about and it's no way going to hurt the gaming industry but rather allow for independent growth. "
"Whoever came up with this backlash was about a million dollars too late.

Also, they're not looking for the big developers. They know who their developers are going to be, and that's mostly indie. 

All of the points made here can be met with a ""Yeah, so?"" Specifically on the later points, where it's said that ""PC is better for games, your phone is better for game"" Yeah, well PC is better than everything if you're willing to upgrade it, and your phone is just as good at gaming-- if you have a smart phone. 

You know what's a scam? A product that doesn't actually exist. Freaking thing's 99 bucks. They're not blowing current gen power away, and weren't pretending that they were."
"It's a 95 dollar console with HDMI out and wireless controllers that I can use to play all of my retro games on my 60"" TV without building a computer.

"It's not a scam, But it is rather pointless in my OPINION. "
"1. not everybody gives as much of a shit about graphics as the average redditor.
2.  The biggest selling point in my mind is that they are highly encouraging developers to use a free to try/free to play model. Let me ask you, which has cost you more, your console, or your games?
3. Power management part is a lie.

Quit the hate..."
"1. Look up the definition of scam.
2. Android is whatever you want it to be, that's the point of it. Yes a lot of phones use it, but it's [not *just* for phones.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_\(operating_system\)#Uses)
3. Poor power management? Says who n what sources? And why is that relevant to a device that's mains powered?
4. Plenty of games, even more so when you take emulation into account. This includes stuff like Minecraft, Dungeon Defenders, Osmos, World of Goo, GTAIII etc. If you think Angry Birds is the only Android game you're sorely mistaken.
5. Why the hell are you comparing it with the PS3 n 360? We know the chip inside isn't comparable. For a $99 bit of kit a Tegra 3 n 1Gig of RAM ain't bad at all though.
6. Android emulation is extremely easy on PC? Oh really, I bet Google would love to hear that news, they can sort it all out for their SDK. Even Bluestack hits the main issue of android emulation: Most android devices are ARM, PC is X86. Many Android apps are not made for X86 and thus do not run.
7. Plenty DOSbox emulators on Android to pick from.
8. Not every android phone on the market is rocking a Tegra chip or comparable. Sure if you've got an SGSIII you're well ahead of the Ouya, though at a fair expense in comparison. But those on Galaxy Y's n LG Optimus L3s n so on, not really.
9. People aren't expecting Ouya to play COD n all that stuff, what part of the project page flew over your head. It's a $99 console that provides a cheap platform to both buy and develop for and with relatively decent specs inside it. promising some decent looking games too.

I suppose the only reason I may buy it is because the price is right.  My old Hp can barely fart out a decent killing floor session. 
"I find it difficult to listen to any infographic let alone one that is poorly assembled and grammatically incorrect. And then, there are other issues with his statement. For 1 the os will be tailored to the system. Second it's worth 100 bucks to have a console that lets you play games for free. I dunno ultimately it's not a scam until a product isn't produced. Then they took your money and ran. Even if the system is shit when it came out it still isn't a scam they produced the product they said they would whether you like it or not."
"Holy fuck, just because /v/ is down doesn't mean you can take our shit, asshole.
Seriously, just stay the fuck on reddit."
"I love how I just closed out the link to the whole OUYA post/kickstarter page and all the hype around it, to big bold letters saying how OUYA is a scam.  You guys sure are a fickle bunch."
is the OUYA a scam? no it is not. but it is however almost a complete waste to make. the reason i could see myself getting one is add in multimedia support and you got a 99 dollar mediahub witch can emulate everything upto N64. but i would not expect anything else in terms of games.
"Some of this sounds dubious, but my real problem is this:

There are people hyped about OUYA?"
"There's a lot wrong with this. For example, you can expect this device (and any recent android device, yes) to put out about what you'd see from a PS2, Gamecube or Xbox. They all render graphics through OpenGL. There are several very nice looking games for android already, full 3D games, of course they look like games from 8 years ago but you can't expect much more than that for $100. But since most of the greatest games of all time were from the 16 and 32bit eras, that's not really an issue.

As for the 'android is not optimized for gaming and sucks at resource management', that's not entirely true and certainly, the OS of this device (As every android device generally has its own unique or semi-unique ROM) will be modified to enhance that, obviously. This isn't gonna be a stock android 2.2 rom, its going to be whatever the latest release is with optimized code for graphics and media on top of that (since power and mobile communications will be much less a priority). Oh yeah, and there are already other TV boxes/consoles, and smart TVs, doing similar things that work well. Samsung smart TVs are gorgeous.

And yes, a PC will do everything better. But that's true with consoles, too. If you're savvy enough, then fuck it - set up a sick gaming rig in your living room with all the nice wireless peripherals and go to town. I stopped buying real consoles a long time ago personally. The key here is that this is a hundred dollar console on an open source platform, meaning the production of games is no longer located in an ivory tower which requires big corporate money to enter. This is something you can buy for your kid, something you can work with yourself as a hobby and see real fun results on a TV with a controller, very easily and cheaply.

The hype is not unfounded; OP just misunderstands what the hype is about. "
"Actually, this has a few things over using your phone with a PS3 controller. To use the PS3 controller over bluetooth, you must root your phone, which some people aren't comfortable with. If you phone isn't on ICS or later, it will not natively support the PS3 controller and will instead be seen as a keyboard. 

Yeah, it's not necessarily the best idea in the world, but they are taking a chance, and there is way worse someone could spend $99 on. "
Holy shit. The gaming elitists in here are terrible. Calm the fuck down.
"This is not a scam- I sort of  wanted a nexus q to play android games on my tv. It's a pain in the ass to have a phone plugged into a tv- what if you get a text while playing a game? how to you pause game and answer it without getting up?  Also, this is WAAY cheaper than buying a TV-dedicated tablet with an HDMI out and equivalent graphics capabilities! 
"
"So much hate in this post. Something we all need to remember is that although this system will be using ""small"" hardware, we need to remember that the quality of hardware has greatly increased in the last few years. It won't compete with the 360 or PS3 on graphical terms, but it's point is that a lot of gaming has become focused around the who, not the what. 

Also, looking at the specs, it may not rival other modern consoles, but it is still superior to the last generation of consoles, the XBox and PS2.

And when considering the power of this new console along with this subreddits obsession with old games, is it really the graphics that makes the game, or the gameplay?

Also, the ratings on the Tegra 3 is for a device running on a battery. It may be able to significantly increase performance with a constant power supply."
I have no idea what OUYA is and my hype level for it is negative.
"The hell is this thing? Never even heard of it until now, and from what I read sounds like a console for just indie games?"
"As long as OnLive is included in this, you haters can shut your fucking mouth."

"The thing that Android supposedly have ""poor powermanagement"" is so freakin' retarded I can't believe it.


First you say that it has poor ""power-management"", in the next sentence you say that Android is based for mobile-devices, which often need GOOD power-management.
Without any facts involved, wouldn't an operating system supposedly designed for mobile-devices have good power-management?


You most be trolling, this is too retarded."
"Remember the price tag folks. It's a low end console, it's not going to compete with all the other high-end consoles out there no. It's not marketed for that. It's marketed for people who want a cheap console to play all their latest mobile and social games on the big screen.

However, there are way more mobile games out there than just Angry Birds, there are plenty of high quality 2D and 3D Titles, there are even popular developers such as Mojang, EA, SEGA and Rockstar that all support the Android platform. Then there are smaller devs such as Kairosoft and Silvertree Media who make fantastic titles too who have only become ""who there are"" down to their support for mobile platforms such as Android.

As an amateur games developer myself, I think this product is fantastic news since it means I can reach a new market yet still only needing to develop one version for the same old Android platform. Keeps the cost down yet gives me the ability to be able to develop games for gamers who want to play my games on the big screen.

Also, Android isn't THAT ""power"" hungry. Assuming you mean resources-wise. In fact, it's done wonders for my netbook and x86 tablet compared to a fully-fledged desktop such as Windows or Ubuntu. Remember, ""unused memory is wasted memory"". It's being used to keep Android in the background, like it would for any desktop OS. This means that you can multitask and assess your home screen without having to fully reload it since it is sitting in very fast memory. 

Anyway, I think that their choice for Android is the best possible choice right now. It's a popular platform for both consumers and developers. There is already a games market right now on the Google Play Store so it shouldn't be much trouble in getting developers to use whatever market OUYA is using. (Assuming it's their own + their own TV/Gaming UX). This means that consumers don't have to wait around for developers to even CONSIDER porting their titles to a new platform. What's not to like about a $99 console? 

Hope that clears a few issues up for everyone. "
"I really like how this is telling the truth. Ouya is actually not a scam, but compared to those HDMI cables that say ""just for Xbox or PS3"" and that are overpriced. The PS3-Phone adapter thing would be much better than this Ouya."
"It's not that this has bad tech and stuff.
The sums don't add up.
Their original goal of $950,000 would not cover enough for the console.
Okay, so they have 13,000 backers at the time they reached this.
Costs would be about $50 - $60 to make this console. So that's $650,000 to $780,000 to produce 13,000 of these. Now. Cool. Not bad right? Well, that leaves them with less than $300,000 to market, pay staff, contract producers, contracts with third party sellers and such. 
Google will have to be paid royalties for each sale they make, not to mention they must first purchase the rights to use Android in their systems. 

None of this is cheap. The Business world is not cheap. This is massive market that will be so costly to get into. There business plan sucks. Take this to Alan Sugar and he'll just say ""Where's the profit?"" You can't do things without showing that it will be profitable. They've not got a plan for all this extra money that's come in. They'll most likely spend it on just manufacturing more. This is the big problem with Kickstarter, it's just not plausible anymore.

You can't say ""This is for all the indie developers out there."" Steam just announced Greenlight. That's a fantastic idea. And what better software to use than what the majority have? A PC that runs Windows. I'm very sure a lot of you have Emulators on your computers. I have an Android Emulator on mine myself. 


It's too late now, but wait a few months and you'll see the failure of OUYA.

TL:DR - Badly drawn up plans. Not knowing costings. Too big a market to jump into. Will fail."
"It's a cool new console. Some of us hate playing games with a keyboard and mouse and like to game in our living rooms.

"Yea, the android emulator part really pissed me off. So many people are bitching about that point, despite never using it. The thing is not good at all, I find it really slow and unresponsive when compared to a physical device"
"Even if stock Android had poor power management (which it doesn't), it's open source. You can change whatever you want. It's not like the OUYA is going to have a phone signal strength indicator on it.

That being said, I'm pretty dubious about the project for other reasons."
"I just want to point out that whoever wrote this also has no grasp of ""processor optimization"" as they call it.

Honestly, if you're a gamer and you think that alone gives you the right to make sweeping generalizations about the speed and power of processing hardware based off of marketing buzz words and advertisement numbers you need to take both feet, insert them firmly in your mouth, and leave them there.

When you understand the complexity of transistor interconnection at the micro architecture level, ASIC design, software/hardware interaction and coding, the balance between lower and higher level programming, graphical instructions versus calculation alone and point instructions, and the basics of efficiency vs cost vs output vs marketing to the general consumer market.

THEN you can start to make stupid fucking charts like this and argue your point logically, scientifically, and actually impress the people on reddit who know just a thing or two.

>1.5 GHz Quad Core derp herp flurrrrrrr"
"Also, even the talk about Emulation is completely wrong.  If you're attempting to emulate Android, you also have to emulate an ARM processor.  If you've ever used the ""base"" emulator that comes with the android SDK you'll know how INCREDIBLY slow it is.

Granted, there may be better emulators out there, but it isn't ""extremely easy"".  This person literally just pulled a bunch of shit out of his ass with his hands and then typed this out."
"Correct. 

I do not think I will support because it is just not a feasible project for the price. Companies are not stupid. If they could produce a competitive, graphically powerful, competitor to Steam on a console. They would. People like to make money... The market will just not support this, yet. I am sure Google has already looking into this idea years ago. "
"Casual upvoting is the worst habit of the average redditor, and we're all guilty of it."
"I wonder why hundreds of people would upvote something so blatantly wrong and sensational, then I remember that I'm on reddit. "
"Yeah, it's not a scam, although it is a bad investment. The points about it not being even as powerful as the wii and it having no games are both extremely valid."

"As long as it's not over priced, this is the way I feel about it too.

Certain games are perfect for this and there's a hell of a lot more android games than just angry birds for fucks sake."
I think you accidentally typed red instead of Yellow!
That sounds the same argument that could be used for why there's no reason for someone to get a xbox or ps3.
I think OUYA is for people that are too lazy to put the computer in the living room. And my iphone can't android apps so this offended me. We should rebel!

"And to think, the xbox only has a triple core! What a scam from microsoft."
"Can't say I agree with that assessment.  The Tegra doesn't have enough fillrate to stomp the PS3's chip, not considering how slow its texture sample performance is, and if you want to make something modern looking with per-pixel lighting that's a major problem.  Pixel for pixel I'd consider them comparable, maybe.

The Tegra3 will completely stomp a Wii, that's a definite."

"To further the point, it would be a scam if they were not upfront about what they are trying to sell and accomplish. They are, in fact, telling us exactly what will be available on the console and any relevant specs. This is actually the exact opposite of a scam."
"> A scam would be getting our money and giving us nothing. 

Absolutely. If Hubbel sends $99 to my paypal address, we'll quickly dispatch our leaflet called ""Avoid being scammed - what to look out for so you stay safe"" The advice is priceless (although $99 will do nicely)"
"There are already thousands of games on the Android market.

And with this getting such exposure, it will only push more developers to take a look at it.

Plus,.. a small decently capable computer that's open to hackers and only 99 bucks? that would be an interesting concept even if it's starting at 0 games."
"Well, fuck me. I had no idea you could say whatever shit you wanted to on the internet. God damn, that just blew my fucking mind.

I don't see a problem with that. OP owes me for feeding my eyes this bullshit. 
>people just assume everyone already has Iphones. some of us ~~are poor~~ aren't saps.
"But you already have a computer, I doubt that machine can run games that a standard computer can't run."
"I do agree with this. My specific issue is reviewing the specs, and the template for developers the quality of game available is going to be near the same for any tegra 3  system. Angry birds, and casual games. There will be some innovation such as the return of adventure possible, or games such as shown in many of the mobile platforms. But, the system will  be interesting for the near future. But, does the have the ability to compete with the lust that is the common gamer. It will appeal to hackers, and indie gamers. Which being niche does not look to provide a stable platform moving forward. "
I believe the failed console you were trying to reference is the [Apple/Bandai Pippen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Bandai_Pippin)
"Yes, but those games are developed for tablet/phone. No more than a dozen would play better on that system, and even then, they're still tablet/phone quality, meaning they're not even close to console quality. Why would I pay $99 for a console to play a few games that look like they're from 2004 and don't have nearly the production quality of any other game. I'd rather pay $100-200 for a netbook and play games actually from 2004 that had a higher production quality. And with that, I could not only get that, but install android on it, attach a controller, and play all those android games that this console has. But then I'd also have a keyboard, hard drive and be able to dual boot whatever other OS I wanted to."
"Except that selling expensive high-powered consoles which lose money, and trying to make the money back with expensive high-powered games shouldn't be the only model in the industry. You don't have to have perfect antialiasing and dynamic lighting for a game to be enjoyable. There are plenty of people who could make great games with 16bit graphics and even more people who would love to play those games. 

There's no reason this couldn't 'compete' with current consoles on the market, People make this same argument about the Wii and it does quite well regardless of the fact that its hardware specs are weaker than the xbox and ps3."

">pay $100-200 for a netbook

where can you get a netbook for $100 or even $200 ?

let alone one with hdmi out and a decent quad core processor with a good gpu

and it's not like the average user is going to be able to get Android running on a typical netbook.. it's not exactly like popping in a windows disc and following the prompts. 

Is the x86 version of Android even open source yet?"
"Here's my humble opinion of the OUYA: nice idea, I was really impressed with the trailer although there are things I don't like, and although I only call them things, they may stop me buying the console. One was the fact it was android based, I haven't seen many impressive android games, so that worried me and what was the biggest turn-off was the f2p model. Basically games are free to get but devs can include microtransactions, subscriptions and other things like that which I very much hate in gaming."
It sounds like you don't even hate Apple... What's wrong with you?!

Even then I always used to wonder who would have internet fast enough to download an entire game. 8 years ago I think I was on 1.5mb DSL, or even dial-up. Damn, it *was* ahead of it's time."
"Well, the company behind the phantom also had a very shady character running it who had been involved in scams/fraud in the past. I'm too lazy to look it up, but it wasn't simply ahead of it's time, it was also a way of siphoning money from gullible investors."
"It wasn't ahead of it's time, it was an investment scam."
"You highly overestimate the power of the tegra 3. It is a quad core, but those cores are being shared between processing and graphics power. An internal intel graphics card separate from a dual core processor matches its capabilities. Also, I was countering your point about it being ""open to hackers and only 99 bucks"". Sure, $99, but that doesn't include a keyboard, as many ports, monitor(laptop), hard drive, cpu&gpu (not shared), trackpad/mouse, etc. 
Or even better than a netbook, the fact that building a computer is extremely cheap and you could accomplish the same things. Not really available directly for $100.
Anyways, my main point was about the games and game quality. People will expect to buy this and get Ratchet&Clank/Halo/Mario quality games, but instead get N.O.V.A./infinity blade quality games at the highest, and very few of those.
Sure, I spent $500 on my PS3, but value in terms of playtime/usage to price, it's miles ahead of the $250 I spent on my Wii. Why? Because of games."
Figures. I was dumbfounded as to how it could support any remotely recent PC title :(
"While that's true, they did deliver on the lapboard or whatever it was called. "
"i would argue that if people are buying this expecting xbox 360 quality games, they are not doing their job of marketing it correctly. noone should expect that.

but thats not to say that it can't still have good games. get a million of these into people's homes and it's gonna look a lot better to small developers to develop a console-type game for it, as opposed to a phone type game. again, not with ps3 level graphics.. but with the graphics you can reasonably expect from a $100 game system.

i mean, if we're going to compare this to a computer that is sorta maybe almost as cheap if you count weird things like it not coming with a ""monitor"" even though you're obviously hooking it up to your tv, you may as well say roku is stupid because it only plays videos, a kindle is stupid because you can only read books, a playstation is stupid because you can't do word processing. etc, etc.

for that matter, your $200 netbook is ""stupid"" because it almost kinda costs as much as my $500 pc that i can play all the latest games on."
"apple.com is US only.
apple.ca is selling them for $110, plus you'll have to pay tax when it crosses the border, so closer to $125.

I'm willing to bet that they're more expensive in places such as Australia."
Not true at all. Microtransactions have their own place in the gaming world and when done correctly are perfectly acceptable. I mean if you bitch about the microtransactions in games like TF2 or DOTA2 then you are just stupid.
"It really does, buying a mac in Ireland is even more ridiculously expensive than in the US."
"No problem. I ermember someone saying it was, but I also noticed you can change your pledge at any time (from $25 > $99, vice versa, etc). I'm sure it's not going to charge you at all until it's over, because it wouldn't make sense/look rather weird on your bank/credit card statement with a crap load of adjustments (assuming you did to that). This is just a placeholder until the pledge is complete, AFAIK."
Sorry it just seemed like you hated all microtransactions when you said they ruined games.

"I only just recently (last two months) finally bought a bluray player (two, actually, but that's another story.) I imagine there are millions of people out there without br players still, so the ""probably already have one"" argument doesn't hold up.

Many people buying a Wii are probably Nintendo fans who don't own a PS3 either."
"Technically it is closer to Blu-Ray technology since it uses the same laser wavelength. If hacked, the machine could theoretically play the discs, just how the Wii can play DVDs."
"Nintendo is always, in my opinion, overly concerned with piracy. It ends up hurting the end consumer.  Cartridges with small memory for the N64, mini-discs for the gamecube.  The piracy concern may be somewhat legitimate, but it don't lie to us and say ""enough people already have devices capable of playing DVD's and Blu-ray.""  I'm actually waiting on the next gen consoles to be my blu-ray player instead of wasting money on one now when the next gen systems will have blu-ray drives.  (I know PS3 already has one - but im poor and cant buy all the systems)."
I wish they just make it an option the person could pay for if they wanted it so they would not have to eat the cost. Like pay 20 bucks for a movies channel or whatever so those few that wanted it could have it and it would not have to be built into the cost of every system.
Just mod it and then you can play whatever. just like the current Wii and DVD playback
r/gaming is like taking a dump onto somebody else's shit pile.
Nintendo doesn't use blue ray disks. They said in an interview (ill try to find the source) that they use a modded version of the wii dvd that allows more data. 
"what the fuck?! I know there are more scummier things than this, but god damn nintendo"
"It could, but it would cost 100 to 150$ more. Nintendo is not interested because they couldn't keep any of that money. 

So, blame the Bluray patent holders for too expensive licensing. "

I don't have a blu-ray player. Nor do I want one. It's 2012. We shouldn't be using optical media to transmit data. Internet is everywhere. Put a 500GB drive on that bitch and let me download the games from your server.

That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard... Unless it makes the console cost less.
why would nintendo shoot themselves in the foot like that. they are just losing a feature for no extra gain... I cant imagine their proprietary disks really store much more data than the BluRay
"I wonder if it also means they don't have to support HDCP? One of the things about the PS3 that annoys me is not being able to do game captures from the HDMI port because it supports HDCP due to having a Blu-ray player, whereas the xbox 360 can use the HDMI port due to not supporting HDCP on it. You can still use component to capture off of the PS3, but it's inferior quality (analog rather than digital)."
"Yea, and it's technically illegal. You need a license to sell DVDs that will play in a (also licensed) DVD player. This license costs money. Money that would probably be wasted on 90% of the WiiU customer base."

"Playing DVDs on the Wii was only possible because of a left over function in the DVD drive's firmware which, as you described, allowed it to read DVDs similar to how a regular DVD player would do it.
But in the later revisions of the Wii Nintendo removed this function completly, you would have to replace the Wii's disk drive with an older one to retain this function. I think these revisions were made in 2008 or 2009.

As long as Nintendo has learned from the mistakes they made on the Wii, tricking the WiiU into playing Blu-Ray disks will be much more difficult, if not impossible."
"Many reasons, most likely. I wouldn't say resistant, really. More, they're trying to keep costs down. The original Xbox couldn't play DVDs without a remote. Why? Licensing. Nintendo wants to keep prices down, so they don't license DVD playback, and here Blu-Ray. Also, the Wii U doesn't use any blu-ray tech. Their discs are proprietary. Nintendo and Panasonic developed them. Same with the Wii and GameCube. The reason the PS3 has blu-ray built in, is because Sony is part of the Blu-ray Disc Founders group. They helped make the tech, so I dont believe they have to license it. That's why the 360 didn't use Blu-ray. MS didn't want to pay money to Sony. The only reason the 360 has DVD playback, is because when it came out, it would've been a bad move to not have it. That's also part of the reason it's more expensive than the Wii. The Wii is so cheap due to older, less advanced hardware, and not licensing DVD playback. People forget, so mcuh tech we have around us is licensed. MP3s, DVDs, Bluray, audio and video codecs, all are licensed (cept for codecs, a few, lesser used ones are open source. However, most commonly used ones are). Nintendo is trying to keep costs down for consumers by paying as few licensing fees as possible."

"PS2 games are 41GB each? Weird how they fit on a 4.7GB DVD.

Even big PC games aren't more than 20GB (although MMOs I'm sure can get over that point, since the worlds are extremely large and it'd chew up bandwidth like crazy if it were all stored on their server). I'd estimate you could easily get more than 30 games on 500GB drive, even if they're all in the extremely big category. And that's the whole point of an online store... If you don't want it installed, you can delete it. And then download it again at a later time if you so choose. I have over 400 games on my Steam library, but you can rest assured I don't have them all installed at the same time. Of those over 400 games, I have over 40 installed. All my installed games from Steam are 108GB.

Either way, I said it as a generalization at the spur of the moment. I'm sure that if they were to include such a feature, they'd put a little more consideration into how big the hard drive is than 0.3 seconds."
"The Game cube and the Wii's disks are written with the header at the end of the disk instead of the other way around (the way traditional [DVD and CD images](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_image) are written). Since the Wii still uses actual DVD's and a fairly standard DVD drive, the hacker/homebrew community for the Wii wrote channels for the Wii to function as a DVD player. I suspect that they will be able to do the same for the Wii-U eventually since it appears they are using standard Blu-Ray disks, just using their weird ""written backwards"" DRM."
"It seems like the less they understand, the more they complain. Probably why I complain about my fellow humans so dang much."
"If you're not buying the Wii U because one day your PS3 *might* break you're not doing a particularly good job of being a videogame fanatic. I understand if you've not got a lot of money to spend on these kind of things, but you can buy a [http://www.walmart.com/ip/Toshiba-BDX2200KU-Blu-ray-Player-Refurbished/19535982](BluRay player for $30).

What happens when your PS3 breaks and not only can you not play your BluRays, but you can't play your games either? I feel some people in here are just fishing for karma from other anti-Nintendo redditors. Not saying you are, but most comments here are ridiculous."
Almost everyone I know owns a blu-ray player and I know quite a few people. 
"I know to most people it seems that way, but as someone who works for a retail store in a rural area, I have many customers who would see the lack of Blu-Ray or DVD compatibility as a major turn off."
"Hell, anybody who can afford $10 more than the DVD version for each movie, and is willing to pay that, probably already has one."
Find Mii is the shittiest shit I've seen since Nintendo land. Can you even call find Mii a game? The only thing 'good' about Find Mii is that it is free.
"WHAT?! CDs? At what point in time have you ever needed you VIDEO GAME console to play CDs? My xbox doesn't play VHS tapes. do you expect that as well? Nintendo isn't even targeting the same gaming demographic as Sony or Microsoft. They don't need to make cutting edge technology advancements to be successful. They target the younger/older and more casual gamer type. You (as I assume, a male between 15-35) are no longer the main gaming demographic. Quit complaining and keep doing what you've been doing for the past 15+ years, GAMING. No one is taking that away from you. Now if you'll excuse me, my hotdogs are boiling over."
"[citation needed]

Haven't been able to find anything that confirms this. Though I have seen reports of a proprietary format developed by Panasonic for Nintendo"
"Badass? That thing looks like a bad 90's piece of garbage. It's Big abd bulky controller. What's even the point of the second screen? It's freaking expensive and has 2GB of onboard storage? That's like 1/2 a game? Other than Zelda and Mario Brothers there content for Wii is mostly kid stuff. 

I owned a Wii for the sole purpose of playing Mario and a few of the Sports games. It grew boring quickly but I can see why kids love it.  "
"If they bothered to do anything with their infrastructure in the last 10 years, they wouldn't need to cap it. I seriously hope Google Fiber puts a fire under their ass. America is one of the worst first world nations when it comes to ISP infrastructures.

There's more and more people relying on internet for day-to-day activities, and they're raising prices and making caps. It's backwards. They need to progress, not regress."
">Find Mii is the shittiest shit I've seen since Nintendo land.

Dude, have you looked up anything on Nintendoland? The game looks incredible. The only reasonable criticism for Nintendoland was when it was first announced and the concept seemed shallow. Once we actually got footage and analysis of most of the games, the game is like a love letter to fans"
"Actually not always. Some drives come as is, with no software that enables you to play BR movies on those very drives. In which case you have to download your own software (either paid for software or illegal). I know I bought a barebones BR drive on newegg that just came in a plain brown box, no install CD. If I want to actually watch a BR movie I need to install my own software."
"Okay, okay, I can accept that. 

That and your little ;) at the end is making it hard for me to formulate an aggressive argument against you. 

But quite honestly I've never seen a film in BluRay except quick glances towards the display TV in DVD stores. I've never really noticed a significant improvement, or at least one that made me feel like I should go out and buy one when they're more expensive than DVDs. When you've got streaming services on the Wii U I don't see the need to buy one either. When it's a brilliant film or a series of them they're nice to have, but most of the time it's cheaper if I'm just trying a film out on a whim to watch it on NetFlix. 

But okay, I respect your choices. Just don't be upset when Nintendo decides to revive your favorite videogame series from your childhood :P. After all, they've already done Kid Icarus and (to a less extent from your childhood) Bayonetta. "
">people I know don't even have a blu-ray player or a DVD player

I don't that that's quite usual, even if it is your personal experience.  Common in college or in a circle of gamers but I'd be willing to be the number of homes with blu-ray/DVD players way outweighs the number of consoles."
"Everyone who watches DVDs has something that can play DVDs. If they don't, they have Netflix and whatever other streaming services. We've got more DVD players then we know what to do with, and that's not counting computers. 

Also, if you buy a PS3 or 360 over a Wii U because it lacks a $20 DVD player you're a fucking moron. You'd kind of be out of your mind to buy something nearing the end of its lifecycle as opposed to something just starting it because of a function that nobody uses. This is like buying a used car over a new one because its got a fucking tape deck. "
"I'm a college student with a job trying to get through school... Not the rich guy you think I am. Yet, almost all the people I know owns a blu-ray player... "
"It's still a significant download, especially in America where bandwidth caps and mediocre download speeds are the norm."
"Find a bar chart with that information and I might see your point. Pie chart is definitely the wrong chart for this information. In fact, it's rarely the right chart. It's a fairly horrible chart and extremely overused."
"Whats your point? Seriously, a better value for the average consumer means it is crap? It offers the most fully-functional motion control in the gaming market, has its own exclusives, and doesn't break the bank. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it crap."
"Wow, that comment just sealed the deal there. You're pretty stupid if you can't see the correlation. Less features means lower price point! Just because you CAN make a console with bluray doesn't mean its a good idea or that it'll make your console sell better."
"If they are using blue laser optical drive I'm quite sure they still use Sony's and friends technology. It costs billions and cooperation of multiple top tech companies to create actual, new optical technology (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc_Association) - Nintendo, I'm guessing a bit, but am probably right, is using BluRay with proprietary file system accompanied by custom firmware (and apparently some difference in physical discs). If you was able to mod Wii U firmware to read the format, it shouldn't have any trouble with playing BD movies."
"Important question: Why the fuck does Sony get to own the technology for reading a type of disc?

Do they pay licensing fees for using DVDs? CDs?"
"We're moving away from the era of standalone devices. If I can replace my Blu Ray player, Roku, and Stereo device by buying a Playstation 4 I'm going to be more inclined to purchase that as opposed to a Nintendo console that necessitates the need for more devices. Nintendo really isn't gaining much by controlling their discs but is losing business by not implementing things that are rapidly becoming standard"
">Blu Ray will never see the level of adoption that DVD did.

I agree.  I know quite a few people with Blu-Ray players.

I know relatively few who own Blu-Ray movies.  I personally own 7.  They are taking up a small section of 1 shelf of my DVD collection."
"It's amazing that this is even a controversial position. I don't think there is a console in existence that hasn't been hacked yet, and knowing what I know about hackers, it's unlikely there will ever be one."
"I suppose you could still rent a game from Gamefly or whatever, and rip it to a hard drive."
"""Not sure what your point is with the PS3. Piracy for the console is almost non existent.""

Not really true, though it's not as main stream. It's fairly rampant. Just not on public trackers."
"I'm stating what I said. Say whatever you will about the Wii, the only reason for high sales is price point. Check the attach rate."
"Than Blu-ray players?  Absolutely.  DVD players are practically ubiquitous, though."
"Nova Scotian here, enjoying my bandwidth-cap free internet."
"It doesn't take into account what the ""complete whole"" actually is. What if (as in, these are fake numbers), in 2009, the whole revenue was $39m. 70% of that is $27.3m. And, in 2011 the revenue was $109m. 36% of that is $39.2m. I wouldn't say that iOS and Android took _any_ of DS's business. In fact, they made more revenue. Of course, this is all hypothetical and not true, but how do we know without actually looking at more data? Hence... the pie chart is a poor representation of what kind of data we're looking at. If the entire revenue was static, this might be usable. But it's not."
"Yea, then you are just mistaking your opinion for fact, if something is shit, people wont buy it even if it is cheap as shit. That's why those fake console rip-offs don't fly off the shelves. "
"I dont understand your hate. IF everyone would stop posting things that are important to them like a cool looking controller or something similar, there would be only posts about cats and boobs on the front page. If you want that then just unsubscribe all the other subreddits and subscribe to /r/aww and /r/gonewild. "
Am I mistaken? I thought Reddit was a place to share things and ideas? Not retarded over used memes... 
"""Something is popular on reddit, better make a post about it letting people know I hate anything that becomes popular."""
"Posts like this get on my nerves, it contributes nothing and it adds to the negativity circle jerk that is already /r/gaming.  Modded controllers, whether YOU like them or not, are appreciated by other people.  If you don't like it downvote it and move along.  Tired of seeing it on your front page after that? Hide it.  Stop being a whiny little bitch."
"Sure, because why post photos of some game accessory that you customized yourself when you can post an image or meme just to spread hate against people that are creating original content?"
"Think about it this way. Gamers tend to be very, very tiring people when they talk about games. It's a never ending streak of insider knowledge, inside jokes, and information about stuff that lots of people don't know about, can't relate to, and frankly don't care about. The same way people think about people who collect pop culture knowledge about Star Trek or whatever else. This is not to insult gamers, necessarily, but to point out that in general people won't find it very cool that you made your controller look different.

On my part, I think it's good that these people are so creative and have done something like that with their controllers. Kind of unfortunately, they use it to pretty much obsessively play games. I don't think that playing games is bad. I think playing them too much is pretty bad, but that's on me and not on you. People do what they do and that's their thing. And I get that people are just having fun and showing other like-minded people how they paid tribute to their favourite games or characters. In my books, that's cool. 

But I do see the other side of that. Generally, people really don't care and you can't really be surprised when people say ""I don't care that you made your game controller have a picture of Link on it"". Inside jokes/inside knowledge/niche stuff does not do well with the general public. Are you surprised about that? That this is creativity is great. I've seen a lot of modded controllers here in my very short time here and it does get a bit boring (and no, now I don't really tend to look).

In short, blah blah blah blah."
Can people stop using that fucking family guy picture? It's more annoying than the shit you're bitching about.
This shit is prime example of why /r/gaming has such a bad reputation.  Modded controllers are interesting at least and there is a niche for them.  But throwing a Family Guy image ontop of a few just to say YOU don't like them . . . fuck off.
"who cares about the modification of gaming accessories?

i dunno, maybe the 2.8 MILLION people subscribed to /r/gaming?

you dumb fuck."
"Really? This is what you're going to complain about? This whole subreddit is basically people posting pictures of crap no one cares about, yet the modded controllers (which are actually cool) is what broke the camel's back? Fuck off."
People who use modded controllers to make them shoot faster or whatever are pussy bitches 
ALRIGHT EVERYONE CLEAR OUT!  The fun police has arrived.  Officer SteelCityMB is on duty and there won't be any shenanigans or tom foolery on his watch.
"""I'm a tumor im a tumor eh eh eh im a tumor!""-Peter Griffin. "
Children on reddit are so desperate for karma and attention. It's kinda sad.
"I'm surprised how far gaming has come in just, like, a decade. Now it seems hackers/modders are no longer praised for their ability to innovate and modify the design of their gear but are instead shunned for it. Gaming going mainstream has been a real double edged sword."
I'm gonna go get a grapefruit spoon so you can eat my ass.
I think op is mad. Seriously this post is so unoriginal and has been done a million times. 
"Yay! OP understands my irrational hate towards modded controllers! 

However, to those who hate modded controller posts; it's a gaming subreddit and you kinda have to tolerate them."
"You're on reddit. Essentially the entire site is devoted to stuff that most people would find pointless. If you didn't want to see this shit, then don't come on reddit, OP."
jesus thanks for this post...i was getting tired of this controller shit
This subreddit is destined to do this dance until the end of time. Trend -> Trend -> Trend -> STOP IT WITH THE TRENDS!! -> Trend --> Trend --> Etc.
I really dont get the affinity of controller mods on reddit. Mainly because most of them look like gutter trash.
"Who the hell cares about anything posted here?!?!?!?!?
This post just have a jealously smell to me...
Let people show their modded controllers godammit!"
Scumbag Reddit: complains about reposts and complains when there's OC(this case in the form of modded controllers).
"Way to go, OP.  The people who made custom controllers are actually topical and contribute to /r/gaming, where what you're doing is making yourself look like a complete twat.  If you would have at least made it funny instead of recycling typical reddit meme bullshit, I would have at least ignored this."
"Agreed. So awesome that one can disassemble a controller and then paint it purple or white or whatever. Very creative.

Could as well post a pic of my old keyboard that I painted 10 years ago or something. ""LOOK AT THIS, I MOD STUFF BY PAINTING PLASTIC WITH ONE COLOR"" Oh and I also have black psp with white analog stick. Damn I'm wild

EDIT: I do appreciate ""mods"", if they're creative. "
Who the hell cares about this fucking post you worthless OP asshole. Eat a bag of fucking dicks.
"If I paint my living room, do I call it a modded living room? NO

For a person with 1700odd in link karma and negative comment karma I think you're just pissed that you didn't post a modded controller.  
"Exactly, I haven't modded since my Xbox. But to each their own if you don't like it simply don't upvote it. I hardly see a point in making a post complaining about it. 

 But apparently it's enough to make the front page, so whatever.."
"obviously for everyone who cares there's 2 people that hate it and hate you personally for liking it

source: reddit"
"hundreds of people upvote constant reposts. That's the problem, the opinion of this sub is obviously split"
"yet their rate is 50% something, so clearly a shit ton of people dislike them."
"This is what's wrong with Reddit. ""I don't like/agree with this! DOWNVOTE."" Downvotes should be for shit post and trolls."
Karma for the thousands of people who don't like certain kinds of posts. 
"Yep, downvote and move on! These posts are more annoying than the posts they complain about."
Because everyone wants fucking attention that they need to make a meme about every little god damn thing they don't like. People need to get lives or jobs or a pet or a girlfriend or something and just go outside for a minute once in a while.
"Because an image is easily digestible, so it's much more likely to be upvoted than a thoughtful article, video, or anything else that adds substance to  a subreddit.  The more a sub is bogged down with images, especially images of the same thing, the further the quality of content drops.  I'm sure there is a subreddit for modding.  If people are going to constantly be posting about their hardware here what else is acceptable?  Mods to a PC?  How about the specs and upgrades on my PC?  Maybe the overclock on it?  As long as it's quick to click and look at a piece of content, it will get a disproportionate level of votes.  The only way to combat this by limiting the scope of material in a subreddit.  Maybe one mod post would be okay, but after that one is successful everyone else hops on the band wagon and wants their pat on the back too for putting some glue and sparkles on a controller."
You're just pissed off that your username has a typo in it. Calm down. 
Because WASD is clearly a better than a stick that can move in every direction. You could have gone with mouse but decided for the worst of both components. 
You're $20 keyboard is bad and you should feel bad... Just like the membrane in your shitty keyboard.
I don't care what they are as long as they stay off my damn lawn. 
"Doesn't RES also include a word filter? Just throw the term ""Modded controller"" in there or some shit."
"Because it's a form of moderation. If you don't help moderate the posts you don't think should be there, they are more likely to be there. 

As I understand it, the mods don't really give a fuck about moderating the place."
"But to some people, the modded controller posts are shit posts."

"You guys are using downvotes wrong, If it has absolutely nothing to contribute (I.E.: Trolling) you downvote it, it doesn't matter if you don't like the opinion, or if it seems bad to you, if you see this, ignore it. "
"I'm not saying you shouldn't downvote anything, but a lot of people think that they HAVE to upvote or downvote. IMO downvoting is okay, but only if a post is extremely offensive or does not contribute anything to the subreddit. "
"Exactly. The blue arrow is for irrelevant comments or comments that don't lead to discussion or aren't related to that discussion. People use it as a ""I hate you and everything you represent button."" or ""I disagree so much with you that I'm going to bury you."""
"Honestly, the only reason I hate these posts is because they trend. I don't want people to spam something just because they saw similar posts get a bunch of upvotes. It's desensitizing and makes people not care.

And yea, there were some controllers that look like someone actually took a bit of time on (the fallout one, even though it looks kinda grimy)."
"I'm always perplexed by how some popular meme phrases or even memes themselves can be the top comments in some threads, but the worst possible thing you could fucking say in other threads."
"Because they put it on a public forum where it is subject to criticism?

I never get why people dont understand that."
Only the sexiest and sluttiest shit is what I want to see. Don't waste my time with boring cosplay.
I don't really want to argue with you. Prove your words and I'll eat mine. If you do not then I will assume you are lying and cannot do what you've said.
"Did I say I think it's a shit post? Really, I will admit it would be cool if people understood what COMMENTS are for in this subreddit, since people seem to think that every piece of shit that comes to mind when they see someone else's thread deserves its own thread.

The point was, the person above was saying that people shouldn't be downvoting the controller posts, because NONE of them are ""Shit posts""."
None of these controller mods are original nor did they require effort.  Anyone can do this shit.
"And when, exactly, does it become ""beating a dead horse?"" 

A phrase, meme, or trend can be popular for quite some time before suddenly becoming unpopular. "
"MKV stands for Matroska Video. It's a file format that combines video, audio, subtitles into one file and is found quite a lot on torrent sites."
"But this isn't criticism. This isn't ""The paint on the buttons looks a little roughshod, have you tried this method instead?"" or even something as base as ""Wooden controllers look stupid as anything""...

... this is just ""Stop enjoying yourself with things I'm not interested in"". It's throwing toys out of the pram because reddit isn't, and never will be, 100% focused on any one person's interests."
"Of course, that falls under not contributing.

Also, /r/gaming is a massive circlejerk, I hate them dearly. "
"But that'a what I mean, the transition is instant. It's ""Oh, haha that's clever, I'll upvote this."" to ""STOP POSTING THIS GARBAGE, MAY THE HIVEMIND HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL"" in what seems to be a split second."
"I think I chose the wrong word, should have said 'submission voting' instead of 'post voting'.

The purpose of the voting system for submissions is for the general community to upvote what they *like* and downvote what they *dislike*"
Aren't you just providing evidence that anyone can do it? If you tried and failed that would prove your point.
"There is an obvious difference between criticism, and the ""you cant enjoy yourself, because i dont like your interests"" concept. It reminds me of the whole COD aspect. I may not like call of duty, but there are thousands of people who do. Why should be treat cod players like shit? Time to grow up"
"No no please dont take it back. You can't go around believing everyone on the internet.  
Had every right to do so and my comment was formed in such way that it raised doubt, my fault."
"Wow, you talk shit because I called you a dumb-ass for a reason, yet say I have no life without a reason. I could be stuck in the hospital after surgery for all you know. The ""THIS IS THE INTERNET!"" excuse doesn't mean you can be an asshole shit-for-brains."
"I hate the plain ones *but* there's some really nice ones, I agree. I've seen a wood carved one.  
That's stuff worth sharing."
"I am not sure what you are arguing,  ummm yes there is definitely a difference between treating someone like shit and criticizing a product. That was my point all along....

"Fighting games have skin color variants so im ok with it
If guilty gear does it then it's based, black brisket is peak"
But seriously that skin fucks. Like holy shit they cooked. Both of them
"Well I mean….the skin is supposed to be a chroma that is representative of Elizabeth Olsen, who is a pretty pale woman. 

If anything, the complaint here should be “why did they make Scarlet Witch white in the MCU,” which is not a conversation I personally will engage in as my opinion of the MCU is that it is basically the Call Of Duty of the cinematic world, and I barely payed attention to it to begin with.

Is it a little odd? Yeah sure. But I think this little oddity really doesn’t warrant more personal frustration than a groan and an eye roll."
I’m sorry you made the mistake of trying to jerk in the circlejerk sub.
"OP is the type of person that gives your sub a bad rap, unhinged people on both sides, we gotta meet in the middle at some point. W for all of you calling out OP's bs"
how stupid does someone have to be to make a post like this
"Doesn't matter. She's not my beautiful wide queen, Squirrel girl."
Oh and when I ask why someone is black I'm the racist one
"Ah I remember you. You thought the game was too busy for you to understand, so now you're looking for excuses to call it bad. It's okay, you can just go play something else you don't have to make up dumb stuff with obvious answers.

Personally I'm just thrilled her non-MCU skin isn't so pale. But it makes sense the MCU version would try to look closer to Elizabeth Olsen like how the Starlord MCU skin gives him brown hair to match Chris Pratt's interpretation but maintains the comic facial structure."
At least we can all agree the MCU Iron Man skin is a straight up scam right? Its 20 dollars for a nameplate/title and the exact same model as base iron man but with a costume tag on it
"Why are there so many dumbfucks pretending to like gaming? Go mow a lawn, or something. Fucking hell."
did you guys not watch the avengers movie or the damn shows?
lmao actually piss off you racist ignoramus. it's a skin based on the movie version. nothing pleases you people
"Just another prove of blackwashed is good and but white-thing is racist, im just pretend that Wanda's skin tone in comic never that light before too............ NO WAY SHE'S NEVER BEEN THAT WHITE BEFORE EVEN IN COMIC =)))"
I mean it’s supposed to be the mcu skin.. I don’t see the problem… this is probably a joke but still. If people actually feel this way that’s crazy. Like who gives a shit if an ALTERNATE skin has a different tone of skin.
"This is wrong, Why are you mad at someone who is white? If you don't like the skin, don't use it, You racist"
I don't think changing skin color would be that difficult for a witch
Genshin Drama is so stupid. Don't even use that as comparison
"""Why are you like this"" is my sentiment towards op

There are way too many people programmed to see issues where there is none and it's always a ""issue"" with something white. It's been years now. When are people gonna go back to regular insecure and regular racist. This ""IM PROUD TO FIGHT WHITE SUPREMACY AT ALL TIMES"" insecurity and racism is a massive stain on society."
"Even I can tell that's the scarlet witch from the movie, and I'm a black woman...that's not too deep in the sauce. Whoever is complaining about it is dumb as fuck."
"I really don’t care about how she look, she could be Asian or black and I still wouldn’t mind but I always wonder why people expect that Romani or Sinti people look dark skinned (Dick Grayson too who is partially Romani on his mothers side IIRC; although it is far less prevalent with him than with Wanda and Pietro). They aren’t a very homogeneous group of people, some are white as snow, some are very dark. Their people have been living in different parts of Europe for almost a millennium after all. Wanda isn’t even fully Romani, her father (I do not accept that retcon) is the whitest German of all time. The whole idea that all Sinti and Romani should look a certain way (the stereotypical way) is incredibly racist IMO. That’s like saying that all Jews should have a massive nose and warts in their faces or that all Germanic people should be tall, blonde and have blue eyes, speaking in a funny manner."
"people hating this post but it *is* kinda gross to turn the existing characters model white and blonde rather than just letting the romani design wear the mcu costume or making a new face like they did for star lord 

its a very apt visual metaphor for how abhorrent the whitewashing really was, but its a little lost when the game lets you pay to make her white"
"So why is 4chan complaining about characters being made darker a bad thing, but complaining about a darker character being made lighter a good thing? Explain like im a fucking idiot please cause im pretty sure thats the only way it could make sense thanks (:"
That skin suppose to look like Elizabeth Olsen version. Are you stupid? Is she not white?
"What’s going on here, now they don’t realize that it’s Olivia Olsen and rant, but on the other hand they complain when people rant that other characters like Kate Voss, Aloy or Mary Jane have been badly changed in contrast to their face models."
"Have you ever watched an Avengers movie? Like are you just trolling? People like you make others who advocate for REAL diversity look like fucking idiots.

Also ""Genshin Impact devs""??? Do they live rent free in your head or something. That is an original IP they can make their characters whatever they want them to be."
Have you not seen the MCU Scarlett Witch? Tf is wrong with you?
A race swap in the wrong direction?! When do these people get thrown in jail for this offense? 😡😡😡
"She is literally white in both of these lmfao, hate to break it to you but white people don't only have 1 skin tone.

The second one is from the MCU

The first one is white just like the second one, and in the comics she is also white, so it sounds like they hired good devs. Cope"
"WhY aRe YoU wHiTe? That’s her fucking MCU skin, the one modeled after the *checks notes* white actress that played scarlet witch in the MCU. This is such a ridiculous criticism."
"I swear people don't think at all. Obviously to license all those actors would be insane. So they just swapped their version of the character into the MCU outfit, which they have access to, and made the character fit the actor in the movie. People's brains are fucking broken. I saw the MCU skins and thought oh it's cool that they did that, they didn't have to. Other people see it and get angry like wtf"
I remember back in the day fighting video game characters commonly would just have darker/lighter skin variants and no one said shit. It wasn't political. It was just a different look and thats it.
"yeah, she and doctor doom are both roma, and both experience some pretty heavy whitewashing in most adaptations (and some comics)

but early wanda appearances elaborate that her skin is meant to be darker iirc, i imagine coloring technology or editorial racism held them back from fully committing to it back then"
"I thought this community was stupid but the comment section under this post has given me hope. Maybe you guys CAN be reasonable.

Nice to see :)"
"The real answer is that the one on the right is the ""Multiverse of Madness"" skin for Scarlet Witch. They gave her Elizabeth Olsen's skin color and hair. The left skin is the default, which is closer to newer depictions of her in the comics with darker skin and dark hair."
"She half Romanian, but has been always drawn pale as snow. Nowadays she's tend to be drawn with darker skin town


Unfortunately, Magneto being the father was retconned because of MCU"
It's not weird. Eastern Europeans are whiter than shit 99% of the time. Romanis look very white in my experience too. She looks Arabic in the default skin
"Scarlet Witch canonically is Romani. While Roma can count as white-passing, it's a distinct ethnicity with a darker skin tone that has its roots in India and Egypt. Roma also are notably subject to prejudice and racism (many places and people still use a derogatory slur to refer to them rather than their proper name too, including Elizabeth Olsen), with many places in Europe still associating them with blood libel and thieft. 

while the skin is likely MCU inspired, that's another issue as MCU so far is two for two when whitewashing people from this ethnicity (Doom and Scarlet Witch)"
"I can see how it would be whitewashing if they replaced the model on the left entirely with the one on the right, but they didn't. It's a skin, it's additional content, it's meant to emulate the MCU version. You still have the option of using the darker skin look.

Would you say they're whitewashing spiderman if they added a Peter Parker skin after already having a Miles Morales version? I sure hope not lmao

There's more important shit to be mad about whitewashing with. Additional skins in a game is not one of them."
white people are the second most oppressed minority (gamers are first)
"Of course no one cares that the MCU version is whitewashed, because you have to actually read comics to know that. People just see a popular film that is getting a shit ton of money in theatres and watch it. Only right wingers obsess over ""lore accuracy"" that much.

You don't have to paint everybody else as an apathetic closeted white supremacist for not knowing the origin of a kids comic book character."
If someone pointed a gun at me and told that i have to choose between being shot in the head or playing overwatch for an hour im telling them to shoot my knees first so my final thoughts arent of overwatch
"No the marvel characters belong to marvel. When the actors dress and portray the character for a movie that doesn’t mean they have rights to the characters look (despite the fact they are the character in a movie or tv show or whatever). 

So no marvel owns the rights to use the actors face/body so long as they are in costume, as a marvel character they aren’t the actor, they are the character and don’t have rights to their image."
Guilty gear still has them. Every character in strive has a black skin palette and dark skin ones have white skin ones.
I was a bit puzzled because my main experience with her is in House of M (2005) and she's quite pale there.
"I'm aware, though my exposure to Scarlet Witch has almost always been games and the first part of MCU (didn't see anything beyond Endgame), and I don't recall seeing her with dark skin before.

It could also just be my memory betraying me, ngl

Edit: also, I believe she's Romani, not Romanian?"
"While this is true, she's not *that* dark in the comics. She's notably brown, but not quite to this extent, and in many issues she outright looks white."
"But not white enough looking to avoid being subject to a gross amount of discrimination. What's considered to be white varies a lot from place to place and throughout time, and tends to be determined by people's prejudices."
Its because they like getting mad at stupid crap :/
"Yeah I am vaguely aware of that, but I was avoiding making any comment because my point doesn’t lie there, my point was simply that it is silly to get angry over a representation of the tv shows’s version of Scarlet Witch, especially the devs, who were probably instructed to make that design."
The ones I've seen are almost all white-passing as fuck.
"Whitewashing does not only refer to skin, it also refers to culture which every part of it, be it her being jewish or romani, was erased in the movies. What i am trying to say if i was not clear is that this exemplifies a version of the characers that embraces her cultural background, and other that ignores it."
"Nah you'll be spoiling the market. Actors probably get upwards of 100k or more for their likeness to be used for X number of years. Since this is a GAAS, I expect there to be royalties too per costume sold. And a deadline means the outfit will have to be removed from the game when the license ends. It's too much trouble for the studios."
"Small rant but this is so etymologically frustrating to me. Romania has one of the largest demographics of Romani. And if you look at it with only the basic information, you’d assume they were the same, but Romania is named after Rome (despite only being occupied by the Roman Empire for a very short period of time and a bunch of other, better names for the region existing) and the Romani are seemingly named after the word “rom”, meaning husband."
most adaptations just ignore it and make her vaguely white tbh
Aren't romanis lighter skinned anyways? Most romanis I've met look white as fuck
"It's because us colored people are constantly defined by our skin. Yet, whenever I try to point out that many 'white' people, *white* people consider **white** actually aren't? I'm the bad guy for not being able to word that in a succinct manner. How can you?

She got her skin color changed for exactly that reason, to look more Romani, to be identified at glance as 'different', because people would think otherwise.

That doesn't mean that if a white actor wants to play the role, they should be barred from it. Inversely, if a Hawaiian dude wants to play Superman, let him. He's American too, but you'd be hard pressed to ever get that across the public. 

As long as it's not an introspection on skin color, like Boondocks, or American Psycho, it should be fine who plays. Which is why I brought up Snape.

Bullshit upon bullshit, modern Hollywood."
"im not sure where the disconnect between what im saying and what youre reading is happening, is this circlejerk? 

they have been colored with white skin, like i said, but they have at no point ever been white characters despite that

wanda's romani mother was introduced in 1979, and doom was revealed to be the son of the healer of a romani tribe in 1964, in the first ever telling of the character's backstory 

neither of them are white, despite being colored with pale skin for whatever reason that they were"
"VISUALLY, they were white coded, likely due to racism. But ethnically, they are not white. That is what the person you've been arguing with has been trying to say"
I can tell you are wrong because is not the case in Spain.
"Depends on the exact type of idiot we are dealing with tbh, it can be speech. Can be that they think they are non Irish by looks which they often get wrong and the individual targeted is an Irish person. I have heard of people(not first hand in fairness) told to go home by these diots for speaking a ""foreign language"" and it turns out that they were speaking Irish.

Due to British imperialism we have a long history of white people discriminating against each other in Ireland. One way they used to figure which side you were on back in the day was to ask what school you went to because Catholic schools tend to be named after saints while the protestant schools weren't."
"In America we get pegged mostly as being from other nonwhite groups. The darkest rom I’ve ever known gets confused for a Black person or dark skinned Indian more often than not. Like idk what else to tell you, but most of us aren’t white passing nor do we identify as white. That doesn’t mean there aren’t light skinned or white Rom, just the assumption we all are white or pass is ridiculous."
"I didn't even understand the part of your comment about Snape. This is a such deep cut of the culture war, that even I am not aware of it.

I honestly think it's just right wingers that astroturf the identity politics in media and it kinda just became a form of entertainment for a lot of people. I mean a big part of this subreddit is talking about insignificant culture war bullshit that people, who spend less time online than 6 hours a day, are not even aware of. Yet it is fun to talk about.

The reason why this astroturfing still works is because woke panic discourse in movies and video games is not only entertaining to right wingers. It is also extremely engaging for a lot of liberals and even more left sided people."
They released as white they were later darkened dependent on the artist colorist so guess what inception she was white same with Doom
Omfg guess this subreddit is full of victimization saying white coded when she was created by the children of immigrants in New York you ppl need to stop using racism as a point of contention to every damn argument you just come off as the racists yourself
"But she's still romani? And Romani people can be white-skinned or dark-skinned, and she normally has dark red hair, and in the movies she's a strawberry blond, are you gonna get mad over that too?"
"And yet, they all end up sounding racist when your just sidelining a group because you're scared of a little 'diversity'.

This shit isn't just astroturfing, I've had friends litterally say this shit to me, a black person, and expect me to nod my head along like, ""Yeah, you right bro."" 

If anything I'm starting to realize this country is racist, has been racist, and will always be racist, no matter how much you just want equal representation.

I'm not 'left' by the way, not 'right' either. Both parties are just enablers of the rich with no interest in helping the common man out, I disagree on both of their policies alot."
"I know both parties are the same. That's why I separated the left from liberals.

I actually had a funny conversation with my brother, when he was getting duped into whole culture war panic with Lord of The Rings TV show. I had to slowly explain to him that the color of the skin almost never matters for characters, except when it's part of the narrative.

And I asked him what was more important to him: character writing or the color of the skin of the character. He obviously said writing. The more I talked with him through this thing, the more I realised he doesn't actually care about that show (he is not even a big fan of LOTR), he just sees that as a fun topic to talk about and finds it entertaining.

Of course US is racist. But that racism will not go away without the changing of social conditioning of the population.

And I'm so flabbergasted that representation in media, which does matter to marginalised people, but to a point. To such a point in fact that for most people of color representation would be among the least significant issues they have with society. And it turned into this perpetual motion machine of right wing content about something that doesn't even mean that much for marginalized people."
"We did come from India, but that was nearly a thousand years ago lol. Most Romani I've seen (and myself and my parents) are all very much ""white"" we just look tanned.

However a lot are definitely darker skinned, but this is constantly changing as they are having kids with lighter skinned people. So the original Romani were obviously quite dark as they were Indian but as they expanded out a lot of them are as white as mayo lol"
"Bingo. Even when I explicitly stated idgaf about this issue. That I know the one on the right is the MCU, people still think I'm taking it personally. For what?

It doesn't affect me, I'm just pointing out what racists will argue for to defend dumb shit. I agree with you, nice convo."
Maybe Silvervale should ask Nyanners about her experience of pandering to the wrong people.
Watching the video of her crying was so weird lol because the anime model with huge tits doesn't have a sad face but her tits continually bounce around as she's crying and sniffling.
"Oh yes, the classic tactic of dismissing any and all criticism as stupid/insane people. I'm sure this will greatly improve her image.

&#x200B;

I hate saying shit like this, but this is apex ""first world white girl problem"". She did something that she knew would have negative repercursions,got surprised when it did, got sad when people disagreed with her and now is trying to just go with ""Did I do something that people did not like?No it can't be it,it must be the weirdos"""
Imagine referring to a bunch of lgbtq+ people and allies as 'freaks' because they dont want u supporting the terf game
I sure do wonder if her using the term “freaks” and her banning the word “trans” are just quirky coincidences!
"The thread is infuriating. 

It’s very very tiring to see people scapegoat gcj as the reasons trans people are getting hate when it’s very self evident if they touched fucking grass that people BEEN GETTING ABUSED."
Doubling down on her coomer demographic. Disappointing.
"Welp, looks like I was wrong. She is a piece of shit after all."
"""but I will continue to pander to lonely neckbeards and pedos with my anime cat girl outfit and big boobas"""
"Says the people criticizing her choices have nothing better to do with their lives.

*Pretends to be an anime catgirl with huge boobs online as her job.*"
"Why are so many people willing to go to bat/tank their reputation/show their whole apparent ass for that fucking game? I can't understand it.  

Also can't believe she is so vitriolic about what has largely seemed to be most folks being disappointed in her.

Also...doesn't Froot, supposedly one of her ""Good Friends,"" have a Trans sibling?? What the hell is she doing???"
didn't it turn out that the supposed death threats she got were faked as well?
"Really really hard to take someone like her seriously. If she came up sobbing to me, I'd be deadpan and look confused. I really dislike people with this kind of victim complex and try to use it to justify their behavior. 

They say if you can't take the heat, then get out of the kitchen."
"I’m going to be VERY charitable here and say they’re just too young to see the fallacy in their actions. The community circled the wagons after the video went out claiming victimhood, which only reinforced the choice to hold nostalgia over the context of the situation. Silver is only going to learn bad lessons from this, and that’s unfortunate."
"Holy damn, literally like, half a step a way from just straight up saying “yeah, I hate trans people”"
"Imagine having a character the colors of the trans flag as you play a game that offends the trans community.

Even if I wasn't on the side of the trans people, that's stupid as fuck.

That's like being rainbow colored after homophobia"
Imagine getting called a freak by a Vtuber… something-something glass houses.
"Tough talk from someone that literally broke down on stream crying, and hides behind a pixel girl mask that looks like she's 16 🤷‍♂️"
What makes this even more disgusting is that their hair is trans colored
V-tubers are trash and remain trash and the people that watch em well…lol
god i fucking hate vtubers. my only exposure to them has been disgusting people and unfunny jokes
"I agree that the people DOXXING her and her friends are freaks not because they're trans or allies, but because they're scum of the earth assholes"
What do you mean? You trying to say it's bad to have fans like [these people?](https://twitter.com/martsharter/status/1626298931645669377) (**CONTENT WARNING:** vile transphobia)
it’s even worse cuz I KNOW there are Vtubers out there that can actually look sad
"By focusing purely on the death threats and insults criticism, she's also cast anyone and everyone who criticized her in the same boat. We can't even talk about how supporting the game continues to actually put people in danger because it gives money to people like Rowling who hide behind their children's refugee charities acting like a good person while ensuring that the loves of Trans people continue to get worse.

No reflection, no nuance, no lesson other than a pure victim complex and yet another blow to Trans rights as nobody can talk about it now without being ""Political"". 

We are rapidly approaching an LGTBQ+ genocide in the next few decades outside what is already going on in countries ruled by far right extremist in the Middle East and Russia or being manipulated by evangelicals in Africa.

Now anyone who wants to stream Hogwarts can do so and dismiss any and all criticism as the people who complain are just ""freaks and bullies""."
"It was so fucking weird, first time I saw that video I thought she was laughing at first for that reason. Or maybe her fake crying is just that bad."
Her crying was so fake.  Can't believe people fell for it.
"I know a large part of the dialogue has been about Trans people, LGBT people and other marginalized groups, but it also affects cis women too and I hardly see it brought up. They aren't even allies to their own sex/gender. People like ""the girl reviewchannel"" and this vtuber are giving money and attention to someone who regularly donates and buddies up to politicians and ""talk show hosts"" that want to make their lives harder too. The games lead designer was a former Gamergater (he's been paid and is no longer a part of the project as of a few months ago, so you aren't ""giving money to him""), which was centered around a woman saying how gaming needed to be a more welcoming and inclusive hobby. 

JK calls herself a ""feminist"" yet buddies up with alt-right figures like Matt Walsh who wrote that ""[I am not particularly nice in how I deal with feminism, but that's only because it's a toxic ideology that is directly responsible for legalizing, promoting, and normalizing the mass execution of 50 million babies,](https://m.facebook.com/MattWalshBlog/photos/a.599201390112975/1524884164211355/?type=3) among his many other horrible beliefs. 

I could write more but this is likely never going to be seen. JK has donated to a lot of good causes, but I can't excuse some of her other glaring issues. Practically nobody here cares if you buy the game, in fact posts about the game are slowing down cause it's old news, but it's still a personal choice to not buy it. A lot of people who might have bought the game were cis women who thought ""this doesn't affect me"" but it does. This is very similar imo to the Scott Cawthon deal, where a large portion of his fans were LGBT+ and he was actively donating to Trump and McConnell, meanwhile JK goes on talk shows with people who think feminism is the worst thing and women should pump out children. I guess even Chris Brown has women fans even after he continues to be a domestic abuser."

"She should do a re-brand! 

She can even make a new logo with a sleek, minimalist ""S"" (for ""Silvervale"") made out of 2 right angles. Then she can have another one of those ""S"" shapes intersecting the middle of the first one at a perpendicular angle, to show that this is Silvervale 2.0, with double the amount of ""S""! And then, to finish it all off, she can rotate the whole thing about 45° so people know it's edgy and modern. 

It's such a sleek and minimalist logo, you can even fit it on an armband!!"
"No no lets stay factual: ""Trans"" is banned by automod. ""Trans lives matter"" however, will get you banned by the mods immediately! :)"
"That is and will always be the tactic.

Well gee we can't give you rights because you aren't nice enough about it. We can't treat you well because someone was mean to me about you.

It's paper thin and shows their phobic, shitty, broken braindead worldviews."
"It's unfortunate. It's possible, of course, that she's referring to just the people who are being vitriolic, which Twitter has a lot of no matter what. But the language is so pointed and targeted and something that people tend to use against trans and queer people that it's hard to give her the benefit of the doubt here."
I really hope Froot tells her to fuck the hell outta Vshojo. Hope the others do too. Froot has a trans brother and this co-worker of hers just labeled them as a freak by proxy.
Froot has publicly expressed her hate for the game and donated to trans charities and melody donated as well so its more of a slivervale L

The other day I was driving down the street and I hit a cyclist. The guy's leg was broken and he looked like he was in a lot of pain. His bike was totally trashed.

While he was waiting for the police/ambulance to arrive, he had the audacity to get mad at me. Saying that I should be ""pay attention to where I'm going"" and that I ""shouldn't be driving in the bike-only lane"".

What bullshit. I explained to him that he's a hypocrite. How could he get mad at me when he uses an iphone that is made in a Chinese sweatshop? How could he possibly have a leg to stand on when his clothes were made by slave labor in SE Asia? If he eats meat or uses gasoline or plastic, what's a little broken leg compared to the incalculable damage factory farming or the petroleum industry cause?

What a selfish prick. Everyone knows that as long as these serious threats to life as we know it exist, no other problems are important and should not even attempt to be solved. Humanity can only attempt to solve exactly one problem at a time."
"If I remember right, before vtubing when she was just uploading videos, she would pander to the pedo bait crowd. This led to a lot of her early  audience being weirdo lolicons. A few years ago I think she realized what her audience was and nuked a lot of those old videos and distanced herself from them. Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong though, my memory’s still a little unclear."

But they'll blame the internet for doing it. Somehow.
"Well then, we just have to mock her for her shit gameplay and crappy character design.

"With how TERF-y Joanne is, it's because she views women by their reproductive systems only.  This idea is harmful to cis women too, are you not a woman if you can't give birth? Don't have periods? Anti-feminists/TERFs' response to this is always ""it's such a low percentage of women so it doesn't matter"" and it's like....no....women go through menopause, they're still women.  Some women can't have periods, they're still women. 

People seem to equate feminism = women, when that's not true at all. A lot of women have internalised misogyny, not to mention some people hate LGBT+ people more than they want to help themselves.  It's gross and awful.

Also I knew the lead designer was yikes, but I didn't realise he was a gamergater jesus."

Do these people think bigots and fascists have honor? That the right will respect all the good work they've done for the cause and leave them alone? No. People like this are on the chopping block, too. They're just too stupid to realize it. Ask Ernst Rohm how this kind of thing plays out."
She’s the kind of terf who’s become so obsessed she’ll buddy up with anyone who hates trans people.
And has gotten way more vitriolic hate and harassment than Silver (and that's just the visible tweets).
Froot got hate on twitter too so I don't know what the fuck you are talking about.
"Thank you, I was not aware. I reported them, and hopefully, they'll get banned so they can 'do something better with their lives'. Like being a Vtuber."
"oh shit, you can report stuff like that? I gotta go back to my suicide bot notice and report that."
"It really is some inception type stuff but hella sadder; to each their own and all that but vtuber stuff... There are some layers there, good and bad. Probably mostly not good though."
Yea I kinda doubt the vtuber who had her mods delete any pro-trans messages could just be anti-toxicity
"Why wouldn't trans people describe themselves as trans?

Sorry I'm not quite understanding you're meaning at the moment, my brains a little foggy."
"There’s even some trans communities here on Reddit who genuinely feel like buying/playing hogwater or otherwise supporting jkr isn’t a bad thing and that the spoilers that we do are ‘stupid and going too far’. 
Most of their reasoning boils down to the whole dumb ‘no ethical consumption under capitalism’ bs."
"Paid to do what, send herself death threats and blame them on others? Or pretend to cry while her sexy cartoon avatar bounces her titties? Shag off."
"Froot is also from UK and has a trans twin brother, which must suck for them living in TERF island :("
"One of the specific things she was crying about was mean comments in response to Vshojo ads on Twitter. A couple people had simply asked if they were going to do anything about her transphobia, so I'm guessing she REALLY didn't like that being brought to their attention."
She hasn't but I highly doubt she would fake it because she has been vocal about her hate for the game for awhile and has a trans brother

All I know is that vtuber cried because she was playing a game and got hated or something.
I expect there was a fraction of actual death threats and honestly pretending to be trans activist and doing embarrassing agent provocateur shit is a very 4chan thing.
dude's too busy abusing his warty hog over at hentaibeast.
"Because they are hiding their hate behind ""For the children""

Remember when people thought JKR was a leftist simply because she trolled Trump on Twitter, and everyone wrote off her occasional ""liking"" of transphobic Tweets as just ""oh she had a senior moment"", ""oh her thumb slipped"", and ""oh she didn't read the whole thing."" People gave her *WAY* too much benefit of the doubt, and look where that got us."
"True, calling out shitty behaviour is just as bad as wanting people to die

"> With how TERF-y Joanne is, it's because she views women by their reproductive systems only.

It's very sad because she has a history of donating to a lot of good causes, but then all of a sudden she's been buddy buddy with people who I would consider very vile and regularly spew hatred towards minority groups, including cis women. She even wrote in a tweet [not once have I thought 'what I really want is to hand this over to a man who thinks feminism is one of the worst things to happen to western civilisation.'](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1546843671626235908) as a response to someone telling her she needs to get behind people like Walsh. Even writing that ""Walsh believes feminism is 'rotten' and his default appears to be denigrating women with whom he disagrees. He's no more on my side than the 'shut up or we'll bomb you' charmers who cloak their misogyny in a pretty pink and blue flag. "" Apparently being trans is cloaked mysogyny? [Yet praises his film, despite how he thinks feminism is a cancer.](https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/07/11/jk-rowling-matt-walsh/) Personally if someone that thought I did not deserve equal rights and could do more than pump out kids created a piece of media I would not go praising it. 


EDIT: Added ""not once have I thought "" to the first JK tweet."
"> People seem to equate feminism = women, when that's not true at all. 

Even I, cishet dude that I am (well, mostly), benefit from it because toxic masculinity is the worse. As someone who isn't really confirming to the local gender norms most feminist movements are like ""Yeh cool bro."" I can dig it for everyone's sake."
It always seemed really stupid to me. You think that just because you’re “one of the good ones” they’ll let you stick around without issues once they’ve got everything they want? Ask Serena Joy how well that went for her.
"Ah, my bad then. Probably happended elsewhere though."
"disagree, there are quite a few trans vtubers who can freely express themselves & present how they want through the medium, even if they don't have access to medical care and/or are still closeted.

"I saw comment like that on another leftist sub on here and it was insanely bizarre.

Their argument went like ''Oh all of my friends and family bought the game and they still are supporting me! You guys are just terminally online and wouldn't support us in other ways (not true at all)''. I really hate how people keep throwing around the phrase ''terminally online'' when we are all are talking on social media websites.

Presuming that person was being honest....are they really supporting you via funding a transphobe that will continue to spread the message of wanting you dead? When the chips come down will they support you then or leave you to your fate? I am considering it not likely that those friends will defend that person if the chips come down if they don't have any self-control in regards to buying a video game.

That's not even getting into the rampant anti-semitism in the game either."
"I only get paid 25,000 smeckles, we should unionize death threats"
"Sweet, I missed Melody donating too. Knew she was pan, but I've unfortunately had to learn that even if someone is LGB, etc. doesn't mean they'll be an ally for trans people"
"Yeah people having a massive platform and being ignorant to gender, queer or race issues is really irresponsible. Maybe not malicious. But irresponsible as fuck."
"So, they were playing Hogwarts Legacy, a game that has to pay royalties to a notorious transphobe. Said Vtuber also banned the word 'trans' in their stream. Trans people and allies were saying things like, ""I'm disappointed in you for playing this game."" Vtuber began to cry on stream, and they came back and said this, learned nothing, called people who hate JK Rowling (the transpohbe who's getting the royalties) freaks. JK Rowling is actively using her money to fund anti trans laws and organizations, and said that she sees her monetary success as people believing in her views. 

Tldr: VTuber got sad that people didn't like them playing transphobe game. Came back and said this."
It is a agent provocateur shit. It’s the way the Black Panthers were discredited by the FBI but now it’s applied everywhere and chuds learned the tactic
He’s also crying in LSF because you called him a dog fucker lmao
">That’s right, she was also doxxed and had her sister’s grave desecrated by members of that 4 chan crowd.

What the fuck? 4chan is still a thing?"
"It's been said before, but creeps and hateful morons can't differentiate between sarcasm and acceptance, often because their communities toe that line.

So yeah."
Misspecies-fying her giant anime boobs is HATE SPEECH.
">stupid Harry Potter nerd

She's got that part right atleast"
"I don’t know why some people have such a hard time leaving behind childhood franchises, I was that stupid Harry Potter fan, three companion book set and all, but when I found out about JK Rowlings stupid hateful views I was fine putting it behind me. Looking back I probably should’ve put it down earlier since I could have spent more time with other series I enjoyed"
"Doxing from Merriam Webster:

>to publicly identify or publish private information bout (someone) especially as a form of punishment or revenge

what private info people shared about her?"
"Oh god I forgot about the whole Walsh thing.  I hate the rhetoric she spews, it's awful and so horrendous and it's just...insane how she had such a big LGBT+ following and she really just killed and gutted it because she feels the need to double down.  

And here I thought her whole manifesto she wrote about hating trans people was bad enough :( it's insane people try and act like she isn't transphobic"
"Bro read your tweet the full quote is:

 ""***not once*** have I thought, 'what I really want is to hand this over to a man who thinks feminism is one of the worst things to happen to western civilisation.'""

Like that's the exact opposite of what your claiming she said here. She said enough wack shit to criticize without blanetly misinterpreting what she said."
"/rj Trans people even ruin shitting on vtubers, so much to the tolerant left"
"The worst thing I’ve ever heard about her was a rumor that she cheated on a partner who was in the military, but that rumor is unsubstantiated as far as I can tell. Even if it is true, British soldiers deserve to be cheated on for serving the empire"
"Some people are reportedly breaking up or breaking friendships over this so I guess this is about to show some people that their actions to have consequences. If some people feel like the game is giving support to something bad, as an ally you should try to support the group boycotting it. If you don’t support it, you might as well not call yourself an ally. It doesn’t immediately make you a transphobe, but it does make you come off as insensible"
"She deleted her initial Hogwarts tweet from the 9th. I searched for people @'ing her account at the time in response to the since-deleted tweet, and there was a lot of disappointment expressed, mostly clocking in at the ""bewildered kicked puppy"" level of aggression.

The real nastiness which she needed to cover up by nuking it all actually came from her other fans ""defending"" her against the expressions of disappointment. It ranged from casually cruel and dismissive to explicit transphobia which wasn't quite severe enough for a social media platform to remove it."
"This is the same with Fuslie, except the crying part. Idk why people aren't talking about this"
What’s LSF and why are they sending their worst here?
"Oh hell no we are not getting into the ""snitties"" discussion again"
"That's if they even bother to not erase theor existence, or assume they're ""lost lesbian"" that have been ""groomed"" by the trans cabal. There is so much projection there."
I don’t think most people really learn that aspect of irony until they accidentally put themselves into a bad situation through their ironic actions.
"I’m confused, this link states, “On another concerning development, the doxing apparently never took place.”

Are you saying she was or wasn’t? Doxing and death threats definitely aren’t okay, but this link doesn’t really provide evidence for it happening or not happening."

"I saw a Twitter thread from a developer who said that the public votes with their wallet, and that since people spend their money on the Genshins and the Fortnite Battle Passes instead of games like Baldur's Gate 3, then publishers weren't going to waste money developing games like BG3. They then when on to head off criticism of their argument by saying that BG3's critical reception and phenomenal sales wouldn't have any impact because BG3's quality would dissuade publishers from trying to compete with it. They were adamant about blaming consumers for the state of AAA gaming, but spent most of their word count talking about the publishers."
"I will say, I'm totally willing to jerk off Larian considering the fact that shit that they weren't able to fit in to the game at launch (i.e. an actual epilogue and different character endings) are coming via patches instead of a fuckass dlc like Fallout 3."
"I just always assume that by ""the next CD"" they mean the horrible working conditions they put their people through, but I guess making a bad game is about on par with torturing your workers for years and them then getting blamed for your shitty choices."
Dudes here getting mad at something he dreamed up 🫵
"I mean they're apparently about to patch them in now, but it sucks they weren't there on release"
"Oh I see, OP just wanted to unironically circlejerk about how le bad Larian is"
Holy shit gaslighting has officially lost all meaning
"Unfortunately, when you've actually played Act 3 and paid attention to their marketing pre-full release, the recent community update sounds more like face-saving and lying. They're claiming that certain content they cut was on purpose, when it was content advertised as being in the game at least a month before full release. When you play Act 3, you can tell they cut it and rushed to patch together the bare minimum required for the Act to still function. It feels rushed and unfinished.

The one companion whose ending everyone is pissed about? They're claiming that was on purpose, but they're ""adding"" a ""new"" ending for her due to feedback. Thing is, people datamined other endings for her that required that cut content, *and* Act 3 itself constantly makes you think you'll be able to finish her questline when you can't (because they rushed it). So, again, feels like lying.

Then they're claiming the lack of an epilogue was on purpose. They claimed they thought the players (of the game that most people are putting 70+ hours in to finish and quite often more) would be bored by an epilogue. I can't remember the last time a good RPG lacked an epilogue. That part especially is either a blatant lie or an oversight so bad it's frankly unbelievable."
"The game company who have to combat cheaters, does not matter the nationality, race or whatever."
"Playing on Asian servers put me off most competitive online games because of the number of cheaters, most often with Chinese handles. I'd rather deal with playing on high ping with friends from EU or NA."
"...or just make better anti-cheat system? I mean blocking region of course removes cheaters from that region, but it doesn't solve cheating problem in general. Or so what - you gonna block EU or NA players because there's cheaters there too? lmao"

"Yeah the top of the leaderboards are literally all Chinese hackers. 

That said, it’s not like people in NA/EU don’t cheat either. Games I play are full of em. Blaming the Chinese specifically is super weird to me and hella racist."
"Their “nature”?

You doing race science now? The fuck is this place now"
">I told them that's cyber-apartheid and they told me go fuck myself.

You told Chinese people that they are being cyber-apartheid.....to themselves? *Sigh*"
"not saying i agree with them by cyber-apartheid? really? come on now. that's kind of crass towards people who suffer actual apartheid. chinese citizens may face many challenges but if having to play in a different region server is the worst thing, they're probably doing ok."
"It’s not “this place”, it’s being brigaded. We don’t tolerate eugenics nor race science here and anyone caught promoting it regardless of the context is getting banned. Fuck anyone who thinks this shit is ok just because “China does something bad”."
"This whole thread is very very sus right now. It's weird because usually GCJ isn't like this, but I guess that, as usual, most people are ok with being bigots when it's against the ""actually this time they are actually bad!"" categories"
"You do realise that crime is mostly a poverty thing right?
Cheating in videogames is not a poverty thing.

People dont do crimes for shits and giggles, they do it to survive/are being influenced by bad people because they have no other option.


People cheat in vidya games for clout.


Literally not the same thing."
"At this point, if you don't recognize that Chinese culture is built on cheating the same way American culture is built on the ""free market economy,"" it's because you're deliberately ignoring it."
"I mean, anti-viruses don't push digital segregation? That's still band aid solution when other region maybe has less cheaters, but you still didn't do anything in the long run about this problem."
"I was stating something, not condoning it. Besides, I don't know if/how they are punishing people for that."
"What 2 of the 3 ""classes"" can join in on the destruction. Which seems to be a core portion of gameplay, at least reliably. Gunplay is alright, no real problem with it. The gamemades, though, just feel strange, like almost really good but the balance just feels of. There feels like there is no point to sniping as the that class can only destroy walls with a breaching charge which is up close, so you'd have to rely on a teammate but no one is trying to coordinate and treat the game like tdm. The game has a bad tutorial, and joining the first match of Bank it was literally not explained anywhere. Audio wise the game is so loud that even after I lowered music to 10 percent post match was just deafening. Game is mid not bad. I might give it another shot later but a lot just left me wanting to play a better shooter."
"HUH? What are you talking about? Is this sarcasm? As a South east aisan, I know quite a few chinese people and they would laugh their ass off reading this comment no matter what region they are from Lol"
"Apartheid is a South African word, thats meaning makes less sense without the South African specific context. People throwing the word around whenever they mean segregation is the new trend nowadays which is incredibly stupid."
"It's most known example, and tbh, it ""technically"" kind of true, with a lot of stretch, but no one asks why is it, most are assuming black are bad and that's all, not cool for them"
"So ""Chinese players cheat because they have reasons, don't be mean, just let them ruin your games, you can't imagine what they are going through"".

Rock solid argument"
"I disagree with the notion that the Chinese culture is built on cheating. But they do really seem to love it.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/10132391/Riot-after-Chinese-teachers-try-to-stop-pupils-cheating.html

TL;DR Teachers try and stop cheating. Parents riot, chanting ""We want fairness. There is no fairness if you do not let us cheat."""
"Yet still, it doesn't solve the problem - players from other region can easily buy hacks from cheaters from those blocked regions + those cheaters aren't gone in region-locked servers, devs still need to address the issue somehow either by hiring more staff in moderation or, yes, making anti-cheater better.

And also, I just don't like region-locks - I have few friends in other parts of the world and I couldn't play with them few games because of this bullshit, so this solution kinda rubs me in the wrong way since I am imagining others would experience the same thing."
"This is about videogames, stop trying so hard to be racist"
"Firstly, I never asked for proof.

Secondly, you made a nonsensical statement that I SARCASTICALLY pointed out without any insult whatsoever (clearly you do not understand what actual insult is). And there is a difference between assumption and deduction. It was a pretty simple form of the latter to figure out what was NOT your identity.


Thirdly, seeing how you are making shit up and twisting what I said to stir up drama, I think I would be quite thankful if you avoid me. I won't be taking part in this conversation anymore. You do you and have a nice day!"

"Some of these replies, man. It’s wild to me how the guy who had a decades long problem with substance abuse and erratic and violent behavior just gets a pass because he played a funny pirate that people liked. Like he couldn’t possibly be kind of a piece of shit because he was good at his job. Weird how toxic personalities foster toxic relationships."

Johnny Depp is an abusive piece of shit and i’m glad people are finally realising. Amber deserves an apology.

"Amber Heard is a spouse abusing x itch!  All she did was cost Johnny Depp money to satisfy her narcissism because she didn’t get her self-grandizing needs met. Finally, someone held her accountable for her deplorable actions. Men can be abused too, though they are over 90% less likely to report it, making domestic violence a gendered crime."
"Are we really still talking about this? I remember that back then, there were a few months where it was impossible to avoid people arguing about this trial."
"whats up with these comments lol 

depp is the victim 

no heard is the victm


how about theyre both bad people who abused people, wasnt that hard was it"
Since this has been posted on Deppdelusion (the sub who claimed its normal to beat your sibling and leave visible bruises to try and excuse Ambers violent rages) I have been down voted lol.
"People must not have listened to the audio tape of Amber telling Depp he was guaranteed a fight if he ran from her - imagine a man threatening his wife by saying she had to stay and get beaten or risk more severe violence - and what did Amber mean when she texted Depp don't force me to be something darker when he fled and wouldn't reply to her? What was she threatening to do to him to get him to go back to her? She really is terrifying, God I hope she doesn't get a third victim."
"Really ridiculous people only focus on the Heard trial like there isn’t a huge history of shit he’s done. No one ever brings up the lawsuit that happened literally right after, where he was accused of assaulting a crew member on set. Or when he lied about Indigenous ancestry while playing Tonto, said he’d buy back Sioux land in apology, and then just never did anything. Or standing with Marilyn Manson, the guy who admires *Hitler* and has an obsession with nazism. 

It honestly feels like the Heard trial only gets the spotlight because people feel there’s deniability there. But even if he was a complete angel to her (which he wasn’t), there’s loads of other shitty stuff he’s done."
I know in the Sea of Thieves collab they did a soundalike and it totally worked for me.
ummm actually he’s just an innocent man who was taken advantage of by an evil woman ☝️🤓
no don’t post this it ruins the “women bad” narrative 😡
Imagine going this far to defend an abuser just because she's a woman.
"i get that depp is a shitty man but didn't she literally cut off his finger and try to frame him for domestic abuse

like as far as i know heard isnt exactly a role model either"
"she didn’t abuse him

it’s 2024 we have to stop saying this"
"Imagine believing a conspiracy theory, having an opinion that directly opposes that of every credible expert in the relevant fields & falling for a show trial where a woman was forced to testify to rape just because you can’t do basic research."
No. None of that is true. It’s literally as fake as it sounds. A UK court specifically judged that Heard did not cause the injury and that Depp was lying based on his own extremely well documented admissions and that he abused her on no less than 12 occasions. He used a DARVO trial strategy to flip the script. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oDdZx6zrzpY
"i’m tired of people saying both sides bad 😐

https://time.com/6183505/amber-heard-perfect-victim-myth-johnny-depp/"
Wouldn’t be surprised if they were paid hourly to shill for that rapist.
"I didn't realise you were a active member of Deppdelusion and fauxmoi, I tried asking on Deppdelusion if Amber telling Depp he was guaranteed a fight if he ran from her was a threat into forcing him to stay with her but I was banned within minutes. I'm also curious as to what her defenders make of Amber texting Depp non stop asking him to come home and when he ignores her she tells him to not make her turn into something far darker. Of all the scary things Amber did and said , those were the worst - I can understand why victims stay as long as they do when they are threatened for trying to leave and then threatened when they don't return to the abuse."
"Depp did come armed for war, not only did he have audio tapes of Amber admitting to starting physical fight on him but he also had her tape admitting to forcing opened a door and punching him, her screaming it's killing me when he wanted to see loved ones, her admitting multiple times he ran from fights, her calling him a baby for not wanting to get hit, her telling him he was hit instead of punched and even her telling him one of hid apartments belonged to Rocky. Not only did he come armed with those he also had photos of Amber looking flawless when she claimed she was covered in bruises. The mountain of evidence Amber claimed she had ended up being photos of Depp sleeping, graffiti and a broken wooden bed frame with a knife on it. Even her witnesses didn't help her."
"And she said she ""headbutted him in the fucking forehead, that doesn't bust a nose"" wait that was Depp to her. Ok, she said she wanted to ""drown him, burn him and fuck his dead corpse"" wait that was Depp again. He said she was angel until they got married. Yet all the was back in 2013 he talks about spraying his rage all over her for NO REASON and hurting her. His assistant is trying to get her to forgive him for kicking her in the back and apparently he has done this on many other trips before. All of this is before they were married. Yeah, you are a weirdo without any critical thinking skills. Only an absolute fool believes a word coming out of Depp's mouth. He insults the intelligence of those that have it. So you are safe."
"""Is the slippery whore that I donated my j--- to for awhile staying there???"" After Depp said in passing, ""I'm not sure I sent that text,"" Rottenborn insisted on reading the other one out loud: ""Hopefully that c---'s rotting corpse is decomposing in the f-----g trunk of a Honda Civic!!""

""I headbutted you in the fucking forehead, that doesn't bust a nose""

""I will kill you"" that one is a actually on audio

""Let's drown Amber, and burn her, then I will fuck her dead corpse to make sure she is dead"" 

He was guaranteed a fight because that was already his pattern of going on binders for days and even at least a week once. When he returns he is an irritable, violent, narcissist that beats his wife. So no, she doesn't want him to go because it exacerbates the freaking problem, which was his drug and alcohol use.

This is confirmed in his texts to his doctor and consistent with Her story because when he cleaned up for a few months HE was able to lock away the MONSTER and they were ""God damned best friends"" Nobody documented what it was like to live with him better than he did. 

If you were booted from Depp delusion it is 100% because you chose to ignore the abundant receipts to any sincere question asked and instead tried to spin more already unproven or outright non credible claims, like the way you tried to spin the comment I am replying to. I get that Depp destroying himself with drugs and alcohol is just entertainment for you. She loved him and it was killing her to see him not just harm her, but for him to harm himself. Also audios on that. He never deserved any of it because he is so much more than just a wife beater, on no less than 12 occasions. He is a malignant narcissist who will never get the help he really needs because his flying monkey supply is so high. The best part is even he refers to you all as remoras and you think that is just his eccentric way of speaking.
The amount of shit you all side step for him is insane compared to the mountain you build on her over just about anything."
"Yup fully edited audio. You are an idiot. I suspect you always have been, so there is no help for you."
"There’s also audio of him admitting to cutting his own finger off (he says something TO AMBER’S FACE like, “I’m talking about the day I chopped my finger off”). And emails he sent to no fewer than 4 different people where he admits he cut his own finger off. There’s also scientifically no way his story could be true (that she pelted a bottle at him and it cut his finger - impossible given that there was no glass shard damage done to any part of his hand, and that would be inevitable if she really did sever his finger with a bottle). All of this was covered in both the Virginia trial and the UK trial, and the only reason people still think she cut his finger off is because they aren’t really paying attention to the evidence.

Practically all accusations made against Amber Heard are just a product of DARVO, victim-blaming, misogyny, or nonsensical fantastical theories to make her sound like a scheming Gone Girl character. This includes the finger story and the lie that “she pooped in his bed”. She was the only victim and an unmistakable, unambiguous victim of several physical and sexual assaults in their relationship.

I really do appreciate when people are open to hearing about it and changing their minds with evidence, though, and I understand that it’s hard when practically every corner of the web is still vehemently anti-Amber."
Bring called a idiot by someone who still believes Amber's lies is not the insult you think it is lol
">His assistant wasn't on the plane

[Stephen Deuters witness statement](https://www.nickwallis.com/_files/ugd/5df505_3af069960ed64ffa8fe68eacf51d1767.pdf)

""The account relied upon above is completely untrue. As I was sitting on the flight, I could see that Ms Heard was speaking at Mr Depp in an increasingly aggressive manner whilst he was focussed on his notebooks, within which he often wrote or drew when flying. At this point, I had my headphones on so I could not hear the specifics of what she was saying but I could see her gesticulating and I could tell from her manner that her voice was raised. She continued to harangue Mr Depp whereas he did not engage with the abuse he was receiving.
At some point, Ms Heard stood up and when her left side was towards Mr Depp, Mr Depp made a playful attempt to tap her on the bottom with his shoe. From where I was sitting, I do not believe that Mr Depp made contact with Ms Heard. Given the position in which Mr Depp was sitting, it would have been impossible to kick Ms Heard in the manner in which she has described it.
At this stage, Mr Judge and I decided to intervene in order to attempt to calm down Ms Heard, who was now hysterical and was shouting at both of us words to the effect of ""did you see him kick me?''.
Mr Judge took Ms Heard aside, as he often had to do when Ms Heard regularly lost her temper, and attempted to calm her down in another part of the aeroplane. I believe I spoke briefly to Mr Depp and he then retreated to the bathroom of the plane where he remained for the rest of the flight. This was a common theme on the multiple times when Mr Depp was abused by Ms Heard - he would take himself away from the situation, often to a bathroom, and lock himself out of harm's way.""


He wasn't on the plane, huh?"
"That is the correct way to describe how I sleep every night knowing I never participated in the smear campaign against Amber Heard, a victim of domestic violence, and that I don’t support a smelly abuser just because he played a drunk pirate once.

![gif](giphy|lAOA8bPS6zLmbJYcuo|downsized)"
"I'm not calling you a dipshit, I was speaking from the POV of... anyone who's ever checked a profile during an argument on reddit. ""Let's see if this guy's a dipshit who posts on r/ AllWomenAreWhores or something"". Way to miss the forest for the trees man. So much shouting and kvetching that could've been avoided if you just saw the big juicy ""IF"" in that statement."
"Amber ""I meant to punch you in the face after I forced opened a door on your head and tried to isolate you from loved ones whilst expecting you to stay and get beat"" Heard

That's how I sleep knowing I don't blame her victims or a lesbian woman who witnessed Amber assault her first spouse, you won't catch me claiming she was arrested for being a lesbian or saying her spouse was warned not to run. If there's a third victim, I will be sleeping like a baby knowing I didn't enable her violent rages."
"Amber said Depp ""guarantees a fight"" by leaving instead of talking with Amber like an adult. If he gets upset and leaves (stonewalling) it guarantees there is a fight happening. She's hoping they can just talk about things like normal people instead of Depp getting butthurt and flying into a narcissistic rage whenever she says ""hey, I don't like it when you do X."" Wanting healthy communication instead of Depp's tantrums and ghosting isn't abusive.

in the audio Depp says he opened the door, then pushed the door closed on Amber and the door scrapped up her toes. Amber explains that feeling physical pain caused her to react physically (fight trauma response) by pushing the door off of her toes and hitting Depp in the process.

You should try listening to the whole audio instead of curated clips from Depp's PR. There's a lot of context you're missing."
"Nah that ain’t gonna work. In her deposition, AH said a male officer arrested her in the assault case (that never went forward because lack of evidence) and no one objected to that claim. Taysa van Ree has also defended Amber pretty heavily and is still close friends with her.

NOT TO MENTION if you wanna talk about homophobia — guess who’s homophobic af? Johnny Depp called AH a “lesbian camp counselor” as a childish insult, he DEFACED a portrait of Taysa van Ree (“he wrote van Pee” again more childish ness) and don’t forget he misgendered a trans man on trial for two minutes straight. He’s just a nasty person.

"It must be so hard for streamers. They want to play the game, but because the world is so hostile, they're never able to live as their authenticate selves. They go online, and when someone finds out they're a Harry Potter adult, they are harassed  and threatened. Everyone is like ""should Harry Potter adults be allowed in public bathrooms, or should they have to shit their robes like a real wizard?"" Such a hard life."
"is ""why do you hate trans people?"" supposed to be an example of this harassment?"
"I’m gonna post this here for visibility

My response to GFRs video is they left out a few things, such as the “alt-left” comment and the fact that they deleted a trans-fans open letter, also I fail to see why the “investigation” must be live-streamed.

Bonus points for comparing trans peoples overall disappointment to Gamergate and showing the name of the sub, which I’m sure won’t get us brigaded again.

Also selectively showing “mean comments” doesn’t really vindicate them either.

The only thing I’ll give them is that their reddit accounts were wrongfully banned and that shouldn’t have happened.

The open-letter: https://www.reveddit.com/v/girlfriendreviews/comments/10za5yt/hello_i_am_a_gfr_fan_i_am_also_trans_please_let/

Like I got curbstomped just for being trans but ig streamers have their own problems
"I understand this is an unusual example, but Noah Caldwell-Gervais has this really great section in his Resident Evil video essay about Resident Evil 5's poor treatment of its African setting, and I think those same words apply here.

>Folks tend to think of racially insensitive as an all or nothing accusation. An extreme and serious charge that invalidates a thing if true... Is Resident Evil 5 malevolently and all-consumingly racist? No, that's not even the argument. The argument is that the game didn't even lift a finger to actually engage with Africa beyond a vague idea that it already had in mind. It was indifferent to its imagery, to the legacy of harm that imagery fits into.   
>  
>That is the charge of insensitivity, frustration at the callousness, the obliviousness of continuing to pass down old stereotypes and perpetuate their work in the world under the assumption that they must be meaningless if they don't mean anything to you personally. 

I completely empathize with Matt and Shelby regarding the harassment, but the actual argument, the true crux of the problem is worded perfectly in that last paragraph. The argument isn't that Girlfriend Reviews are malevolent transphobes. The argument is that during a request for a boycott of the game, they were indifferent to the legacy of transphobia perpetuated by Rowling by still playing the video game that would actively contribute to her wealth (even if they didn't pay for it, the side effect is that many of their viewers would) and influence; wealth and influence she will use to harm trans people. 

There are a lot of games they haven't reviewed or broadcast on their channels, and Hogwarts Legacy could easily have been one of them. So hopefully they understand how distressing it is to see that they would compromise their desire to gesture complete support for trans people in this circumstance for the sake of loyalty to a job description. 

Simply put, If your dedication to your stated ideals to show complete support for trans people stops the moment it's mildly inconvenient for you, then your convictions were never built on solid ground to begin with."
"Damn the thumbnail alone kind of destroys any benefit of the doubt you would want to give them.

they're really milking this one for all it's worth.  very shameless.  they might as well start selling T-Shirts that say ""Hogwart's survivor""."
"I've said it in other threads here and say it again - the genuine harassment they received, including being locked out of their subreddit and their reddit accounts, was not warranted. But as someone who's always really enjoyed GFR's content and absolutely *hated* the shit they went through from the TLOU2 sub, I found this vid really disingenuous.

Given explicit condemnation of transphobia and their donations to The Trevor Project,  I would have said they demonstrated the *intent* of allyship, despite obviously and overtly failing the bare minimum of *listening to what trans geeks have asked other geeks to do about this game for literal months* \- i.e. refrain from either directly paying for the game or promoting it to a broader audience.

This video - along with their purportedly-accidental deletion of an extremely gently-worded open letter from a trans fan from their subreddit - reeks of a key problem. It feels they are using the (again, legitimate) harassment they received to dismiss any and all criticism they received for promoting the game in the first place.

""We are ~~journalists~~ reviewers and its our job"" is well-and-good if you're employed by a news company. We all make moral compromises to survive under capitalism. It rings *deeply* false when coming from folks who work for themselves and have never had a blanket mandate to cover *every single new game*. Shelby invoking her Judaism likewise feels like a shield to deflect from legitimate criticism - it's like she's claiming ""n-word privilege"" because the game has material that's offensive to her as well.

For folks curious about how this *should* have been handled instead of streaming Wizard Game itself, look at Eurogamer's YouTube channel. They did a charity stream of HP-adjacent cozy games that profit indie developers and donated their stream profits to Mermaids."
"Have i been missing out on something, i don't browse this subreddit for a month or two and suddenly all this stuff is going. What's going on, did i miss something?"
"What I find really weird about this is that like. The reply’s they got is pretty tame by internet standards. 

Like this video is getting xposted across Reddit with every sub acting like it’s a crime against humanity. But I distinctly don’t remember anywhere near this level of outrage last time a controversial game or game review dropped.

Like it just seems like a chance to dunk on SJWs while the typical alt-right driven hate mob gets a free pass because it’s expected."
"I used to be a massive Harry Potter fan and years before my dream was a full rpg game developed in that world…I did not buy the game and it’s not even to not get money to Rowling, she’s already set for life and my 70$ are not going to make a big difference with all the royalties she gets, it’s the narrative this game has been giving to outside media.

Suddenly a lot of people feel comfortable saying that “they got nothing against trans people but…” and it’s sad, I don’t have any trans person in my life (that I’m aware of at least) but I know and I’ve seen how marginalised they are in communities just for living their lives, the fact that this game it’s promoting those spaces of hate it’s enough for me to not be participant."
"The absolute hilarious part is the gamers do this every day.  Hell it got so bad that the united nations even held a conference to talk about how evil gamers are. 

But yes a handful of incidents on a website who's main appeal is hate brigades and watching people unalive themselves is the nail in GCJ coffins."
"Also kinda insane they completely ignore some of their fans going full transphobe mode on their sub, hence the ban."
"The boycott is a non-organized action that is just about not buying the game, how come all boycotters (and commonly all trans people) are blamed for fringe actions that this sub has never called for or supported?"
"/uj

all that needs to be said is to look at the comments on the video. the ones seal-clapping are people who are either explicitly anti-trans, the ""see, the wokes are so evil!"", ""this is the audience you cultivated by being woke lol"", the ""both sides bad!!!"" etc.

If I posted a thing and the only people cheering me on were those types... well. I think I'd reevaluate what impact my words and actions were making"
Did their video even attempt to discourage people from doing that?
I thought trash talk was just part of the “g@m3r experience”?
So apparently this sub is now more hateful than the TERFS and transphobes. according to the gamers (tm). The more you know.  🌈 ️‍⭐️
"Lmao all the comments on that video: ""Oh my god I am so sorry this happened to you, we're here for you, this hate campaign against you is so terrible 😥"""
I am pretty sure the hate being spread to streamers for playing the game is actually being done by right wingers though?
"I’m just disappointed in these two, like a parent who’s child got in trouble at school and the kid keeps doubling down that they didn’t anything wrong instead of just admitting they just didn’t think in the moment and will do better.

I’ve watched GR since the very beginning and they were always one of my favorite channels. Their reviews were nice and charming  and they had some actual intelligent videos with good view points like with their Death Stranding and Cyberpunk controversy videos. They were always just a nice review channel. Even when they went through controversy with TLOU PT II, I and a lot of others supported them as they made their way through it.

So everything with them and this game just makes me feel more and more sour towards them. Like, they had to have known the stigma around the game. They had to have known the controversies. They had to have known the backlash they were gonna get, especially when the tweet promoting their streams of it and the titles of their streams gave off the feeling of “Hey guys come watch us play fun Wizard game!!!! :)”

Now some of the harassment they got wasn’t deserved. Being locked out of their Reddit account and subreddit is shitty and they don’t deserve that. And I’m sure they got a few nasty messages.

But honestly a lot of the harassment they got wasn’t that bad at all. It was kinda dickish at most, but it’s nothing compared to the harassment that trans people go through on the daily just for existing. Hell around the same time this game dropped Brianna Grey, a trans teenager, was murdered by two classmates because of transphobic alt right beliefs they had, in the UK no less, the country where JK Rowling resides and funds money into transphobic laws. Brianna was was born in 2007, only 16 years, a life cut short because of transphobic rhetoric pushed by bigots like Rowling. When tragedies like these happen to trans people every day, I kinda find it hard to care that reviewers are being called names for playing the game that funds hateful people like JK, who cause tragedies like these, directly or indirectly.

Going back to GR, I know even they say the harassment they faced was blown out of proportion, but the entire way they presented this video just felt disingenuous. The “you critique product yet use iPhone and Twitter” argument being used unironically, Shelby bringing up the fact she’s Jewish to defer some critiques. Matt on stream calling people who call them out “alt-left.” It’s just…it all feels so defensive. Like they know what they’re doing is bad but they’re constantly trying to find ways to defend themselves.

I know they say they’re “gaming journalists,” but the difference between them and a IGN reviewer is IGN reviewers don’t pick what games they play and could be fired if they refuse to. GR are self run and have skipped on many big published titles. Dead Space, Hi Fi Rush, Callisto Protocol, they could’ve made videos on any of these games and instead chose this. Even if they wanted to call out the problematic aspects of this game they could’ve just played it privately and then make a video on those problematic elements. In general, this could’ve been avoided.

Their arguments in this video and their streams have the energy of “we call ourselves ally’s and yet people are being mean to us and saying we’re not.” When they need to understand that they can never imagine what a trans person goes through on a daily basis. It’s like with race, you and I will never know what it’s like to be another race and experience what they go through and the unique struggles they face as well. When someone of the opposite gender, sexuality, race etc tells you something is insensitive and they’d like it if you don’t do that, you should listen to them. You shouldn’t still do that thing and thinly veil it with “Oh but I’m doing charity for you while I’m doing it! :D”

You’re still doing the thing that group of people asked you not to do. You can’t be surprised afterwards when they say you’re not an ally because you specifically went against what they told you to do, and if anything hiding behind the fact you “did it for charity” feels cheap and patronizing, adding to the blow for that group of people. 

And again, they’re not like a child or someone who doesn’t go on Twitter and plays the game, not knowing about the controversies around it, or a employee at a gaming website who has to play it or else they can’t feed their family, they chose to play this and are now facing the repercussions. I still think they are talented people who make really good videos, but this controversy and how they’ve reacted to it has soured (~~getting tired of that word yet?~~) my view on them, and I think I need to stay unsubscribed from for about a year or so before I think about watching them again.

This comment was more of a vent for myself, but to give it some ending, because of them choosing to play this game and their response they’ve likely alienated a lot of their LGBT viewers because of it. And they’ve likely attracted a lot of the anti-woke crowd who they’ve largely fought against because of this. Either way they don’t win here unlike with TLOU PT II.

And with all of the controversy and shouting and fighting and hating of this game and all of the vile it’s produced by simply existing, the game’s not even good enough to be worth defending over, and it’s not even terrible enough to worth taking a look at. It’s just a mediocre middle of the road open world game, one of the many a year that simply get ignored and, at most, get a simple “Oh yeah that came out” years after it released in the bargain bin or on sale for $3 on a digital game store in the middle of the deals. So all of this controversy with their channel and the game in general just wasn’t worth it.

All in all, I’m tired, I’m gonna go do something that makes me happy now. 

TL;DR: If you skipped over this long ass reply just take away this one thing, love the trans people in your life. If you have a trans family member or friend, text them you love them and give them a hug if you can. If there’s a trans content creator you like, support their work and maybe @ them on Twitter and tell them how cool you think their work is. And if you tell you something you do is hurtful to them, listen to them. And if they say you can help them someway, help them. Show them you genuinely care and love them. It’s scary out there for them rn, and you never know how much support they really need.

And if you’re trans and reading this: I’m proud of you. You deserve all the love in the world, and you’re doing great. Have a good night 🏳️‍⚧️"
"I just wanted to relive my childhood*

*pour 40+ hours into a generic RPG with a thin veneer of a bad fantasy IP I never grew out of"
Me when I voice slight concern and disappointment for choosing nostalgia over listening to trans people (I am a cyberbully)
"Okay so genuine question, I see alot of people saying this sub caused brigading but I genuinely don't see how? We always hide names and communities of note are rarely linked directly to. I also didn't really think anyone here disliked girlfriend reviews, like at all. And honestly I didn't even see any evidence of that in their video. Just some shit memes from this sub. I'm seeing people calling for this sub to be banned completely but I really really don't understand... why... Like I've been lurking here every day and I've not seen anything that would have made me think it was genuinely happening. Like at all. Am I blind, stupid, both? What the actual hell is going on? I feel like I've woken up after a coma or some shit.

Edit: Aaaand immediately getting downvoted for a question that this community definitely wouldn't downvote lol. Anyway apparently we're the bridgaders. Cheers lads."
">two negative comments

Oh the horror, I'll be sure to tell the evil mean transes to keep it down in-between politicians trying to legislate them out of existence and fascists trying to kill them"
"Uj/ because the examples provided are all extremely tame and it feels like they’re disingenuously milking this whole thing I just want to say…

As an entertainer you’re not entitled to views. If your core audience is expressing a distaste for what you present, that’s not ‘bullying’ or ‘harassment’. It’s criticism and you can choose to either apply it and adjust your content accordingly to keep your audience entertained and happy, or you can cry about how it’s unfair that people don’t like your video/stream/whatever and act like there’s a hate brigade coming for you. 

It seems like Girlfriend reviews has picked the latter option, and it definitely means I’ll never watch their content anymore. YouTubers are dime a dozen, and there’s 1000’s of others that will present ‘game reviews with a gimmick’ and not cry wolf."
"Watched the video. It was okay but it still felt like they were trying victim. They only have two examples of hateful comments and seem to completely forget the fact that they could have just not played the game to show solidarity with lgbt people. And continuing to double down on the whole lgbt charity thing feels kinda scummy imo because again they could have just not played it. The whole “I’m Jewish so I should be allowed to play the game” take was weird. While I don’t think they deserved being subjected to media storm, I also don’t think they should call themselves allies since an actual ally wouldn’t have even thought about playing the game if they knew it would hurt trans people. 

Also they unironically used the “and yet you tweeted this on an iPhone” argument

Honestly I’m getting tired of Hogwarts legacy. That pile of dogshit doesn’t deserve all the attention it’s been given from both streamers and us."
"Oh shit, the fake white “allies” dropped their “trans people are the alt-left” youtube video finally and are crying more white tears😢😢😢😢"
"Streamers stop framing milquetoast criticism as their own ""personal Vietnam"" challenge 2023 (Impossible)"
"as I've said before I don't think Shelby and Matt are bad or malicious people, but I do think they're simply not listening. To see the same old ""you're sending me messages of disappointment from your slave labor iPhone"" arguments from them is disappointing. Shelby using being Jewish as like... permission to play the game was weird at best. Most of the messages they put in the video were harmless ""I am disappointed and going to unsub"" statements they were framing as harassment. I don't know, it just felt hollow."
"Oh look, one mean person who disagrees with me. As we all know, this completely justifies my actions and makes my enemies ontologically evil."
if you down vote  my posts i IWLL cry and you will be EVIL WOKE MOB!
"Weren't they exposed for overplaying the ""hate"" they got?"
remember child murder is a ok but an anime girl crying is utterly heartbreaking
"Honestly, I'm disappointed in them. I get having your reddit account shut down is completely over the top, and the pedophile bit was completely uncalled for.

But the way they almost ignored their viewers grievances and almost acted they like they were nonsensical for being disapproving Of the game, rubs me the wrong way. Been a long time fan, since their first video, but I think I'm going to unsubscribe from them.

They can argue they're allies all they want, but the video just perpetuating the us vs them narrative."
"People when you tell them not to play Blood libel the video game (they have childhood nostalgia for Harry Potter and the protocols of the elder scrolls of Zion)

Grow up. Stop consuming the most milquetoast shitty fantasy that's doing real harm. I used to be a huge Harry Potter and Ender's game fan but then I realized I was doing harm and stopped consuming that media. It's not hard."
Does she genuinely think people disagreeing with her is worse than antisemitic stereotypes in the game 😭
"just tired of hearing about this, trans people are dying and having rights taken away."
"So... after watching that video, let me get this straight:

You clear the record about the clip people are trying to use to prove trans-people are the real bullies, say you weren't crying, and disagree with the people claiming you were ""bullied off stream."" 

You talk about the hateful messages on chat, and downplay it because you're used to it. You bring up how a lot of fans, many of whom are trans themselves, are voicing their disapproval of you choosing to promote this game by streaming it to your audience of thousands.

You say outright that JK Rowling is a transphobe who uses her money in transphobic means like funding anti-LGBTQ activity. While at the same time, there are many people within this game's player-base alternating between using your treatment as a scapegoat to villainize trans people, and then saying, ""BuT wHaT dID jK SaY tHaTs TrAnSpHoBiC?""

And finally, you say outright that the goblins in this game evoke antisemitic propaganda, similar to that of previous nazi depictions used to demonize Jewish people. Something that a lot of people within the player-base either deny the connection of, or jokingly blow off. 

Now, after ALL that. You go the ""gamers are the truly oppressed minority"" route, and are like, ""funding TERFs, a game laced with antisemitic stereotypes dating back decades, and a loud portion of the playerbase rallying behind this game as an overt signal of their transphobia? that may lead to making minorities such as transgender people within my audience feeling villainized and unsafe, but it STILL doesn't make ME AS A STREAMER feel as villainized and unsafe as promoting the game with ALL that rhetoric surrounding it in front of my audience of thousands, and getting backlash over it."" 

Yeah, no. The Paul brother strategy of donating to charity is a step in the right direction, but they should have put their foot down, NEVER have streamed this game, not benefit off the traffic connected to this game, and decline giving this shit a spotlight to their audience.

I became a fan of them ever since their clapback of r/thelastofus2, but I can't agree with them on this. It's true that they don't deserve to have stuff like having their subreddit locked. But a large part of them needs to understand that when rhetoric surrounding the game is THAT bad and they chose to give it a platform, don't be surprised when the people in your audience that rhetoric is targeted after see you as being part of the problem."
"I feel bad for her, but the video is also doing the thing she said was bad and bringing a crowd of people to brigade this sub."
"No I checked out their stream yeah the stuff said wasn’t great but it wasn’t as if it’s a death threat or calling them a slur. They were called scumbags.

Edit: I am NOT saying that this is good, simply that they’re overreacting. It’s still shameful but not as bad as people would have u believe"
"I fucking hate the ""it's my job"" argument in this situation. No the fuck it isn't. You are self employed. There isn't a person above your head saying ""stream this or lose your income"", you still have the power here to choose what do you want to do. Especially taking into consideration that they had a sponsor on pretty much every single one of their videos for quite some time. They (most likely) had the money to spare, were able to make a decision whether to promote this game or not and still decided to go with it.

I get that it's really hard to be 100% morally correct person in this day and age but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try."
"damn first dunkey and now girlfriends reviews??? can't believe they're bowing down to SJWs and admitting that this game is controversial!

/uj yeah I'm unsubscribing from girlfriend reviews. I know they try to be trans allies, but this is not how you do it. 

it's really unfortunate that they got harassed, and that should not have happened, but it's not like they're the only ones getting harassed. 

not to play the oppression olympics here, but trans people are also harassed constantly for being who they are. saying that you got harassed when you choose to play the transphobic wizard game when practically every trans person on the internet has been calling for a boycott on it just really hurts.

if they wanted to be an ally, they should not have played it in the first place."
"Ok no, fuck these people. You can't claim ""it's our job to review video games"" when you're a self-run channel. Call me when you work for a big website who will fire you for not doing it. You could have just not played it and put up a video about why it's so harmful. Playing, getting called out, and then playing the victim just makes you an asshole.

Edit: Keep replying you chuckle fucks. I'm blocking everyone coming here to defend playing a game that harms Trans people. You know what you're doing and the fact that you feel no shame about it makes you the shittiest kind of person. Seriously though. I welcome the abuse. I'm not trans I'm autistic, which means your childish abuse means nothing to me. But I'd rather it be me than an actual trans person so. By all means. Line up so I can report you all one by one."
"A trans girl was murdered because of JK but sure, let's all be sad someone cis cried."
"/uj I generally like that channel but I honestly cannot overstate how much I do not care about whatever shit they're getting. the one single thing trans people have been asking is that people don't play this game. not that they play it and crap on it a bunch in the name of trans people, not that they play it and throw money at charities to feel good, not that they play it and make a mod to turn every texture into a trans flag, that they just play something fucking else. it's not hard, this game has absolutely nothing unique about it and every part of it has been done better elsewhere. want magic? play noita. want bosses? play dark souls. want antisemitic propaganda? take your damn pick."
Man imagine making that video still after streaming this game. Seeing how much of your chat was filled with anti trans stuff and then being like “actually it’s the people who asked us to not play the game who are the real problem and have gone too far”
"Was it? I’m still getting totally random comments from weirdos asking me why I hate fun or what the fuck ever. Though OP is probably right that it will probably get worse again.

It’s *amazing* the monolithic boogeyman they make us out to be. This exact video got posted to gaming earlier and comments were cream of the crop. Mourning the tragic downfall of GCJ which “used to be funny.”

We’re very funny. We bully transphobes and illiterate chuds all the time!"
They’ve been so fucking annoying. Like sorry someone was kinda mean to you cause you played the wizard game. At least JK Rowling is not Tweeting about how you are a pedophile rapist not fit to live in our society. But yeah sorry about the dislikes on your HP video or whatever that’s pretty rough too man
"I can't wait to jump out of my ship, land on a rock at a slight angle, turning me into an eldritch horror spazing out into the sky."
the screenshots of threads that are cropped just right so they don't show the number of upvotes is some incredibly transparent shit.
It would take 5 seconds of scrolling for anyone who thinks that this place is an organized hate group to see that is so fundamentally untrue.
true they are always ridiculous but i feel bad for the mods its gonna get so much worse with this sub being heavily featured in the video
"yes. another example used in the video is ""Disappointed you decided to stream this game. unfollowed"" its vicious"
transphobes always complain about being called a ‪TERF and ONLY transphobes complain about TERF being a “bad word”
"Thanks for posting those links. I listened to their whole speech about this starting at \~the 57 minute mark, and it's certainly disappointing. The whole ""some gay people say it's fine that we're playing the stream and others don't, so since your community isn't a monolith we can do whatever we want!"" line quite bothered me. Like, you can also find queer folks who think gay marriage should be illegal. You can find wildly transphobic LGB folks. Saying you should listen to minorities doesn't mean you don't also have to have values and do the work yourself to figure out what's right. We'll never get every single LGBTQ+ person to agree on everything, but that doesn't mean right and wrong don't exist anymore. It just means you have to take ownership of your own actions and use some critical thinking skills. But yeah, sorry, forgot I should be bending over backwards to thank them for their ""allyship"". ""We suffered for being allies over TLOU2, so how dare you criticize us now” jfc"
">Bonus points for comparing trans peoples overall disappointment to Gamergate

The complete irony of calling their critics reminiscent of gamergaters when what *actually* happened during gamergate was ""normie"" gamers and streamers getting whipped up by the alt-right into normalizing their hate campaigns against LGBT folks and women.

History may not repeat itself but it's certainly written in stanzas."
Huh. I found those exact same stats for people who get sad that the ending of a mediocre video game was ruined for them. Weird.
"Completely agree, I'm also the same as you but not straight lol"
As a straight cis Man I alway go into these things with the understanding that I really don’t understand what people in the community face at all. I can empathize and be open but that’s it. I don’t get why this pair didn’t stop and try to understand why and how streaming this made the common upset and disappointed. Instead they made a video saying “no ethical consumption under capitalism” and “but you weren’t trying to understand me!” Instead of listening to the group upset. Yeah I get the ethical consumption thing to a point but laugh when it’s over shit that you didn’t need. Like just because the way things are structured to be reliant on products and services from unethical companies it means people can’t speak out against useless ones that harm marginalized communities. The video was all around stupid. I started skimming halfway through because the arguments were bad.
"The true oppression is being lightly criticised for supporting a product that financially supports a very open and loud transphobe.

I could’ve sworn it was the trans people being murdered, constantly harassed and attacked, but I guess it’s hard getting criticised for buying a video game too."
"Excellently put. 

What really bothers me about Matt and Shelby’s behaviour is the total self-justification and lack of reflection. I’ll put my hand up and say I don’t know what it’s like to be at the centre of this type of attention and harassment. But I don’t know how they can acknowledge that the majority of the backlash is from people just expressing disappointment in Girlfriend Reviews and not consider that maybe they did something wrong. 

Hell, watch the first 5-minutes of their stream, they’re clearly on the defensive and trying to call out anyone who criticises their choice to be part of the Hogwarts Legacy’s marketing."
"wait did girlfriend reviews actually say the ""alt left""? real disappointing. I assumed they were based"
"smh the ""alt left"" were the ones fighting the neonazis in Charlottesville, not liberals calling leftists ""alt leftists"" at the time"
"I stupidly made some comments defending this sub over there. Saying that the hate toward this sub was misdirected.

The replies I’ve gotten have been disgusting tbh. Just so many people that were waiting to hate trans/trans allies and used this whole thing as a shield to do so."
"Couldn't have put it better myself. Harrassment is never acceptable, but that doesn't mean we can't legitimately criticize someone when they do something hurtful and dangerous. The NYT article just goes to show that our fears about promoting this game would have were well founded."
"As a trans woman, I agree with basically all you've said. The ""we're journalists"" argument doesn't hold any weight when you look at their style and the content they're covering. They didn't cover Dead Space remake, Callisto Protocol, or Hifi Rush, so clearly they don't feel like they have to talk about every major release the way a site like IGN has to. The tweet in which they announced that they'd be streaming the game also sounded quite excited.

I also thought her saying that she's Jewish was weird. You can definitely play a game to see whether it's actually antisemitic, but parading it around on stream and showing it to potential buyers is something completely different.

In general, I felt like they either missed the point of the criticism they received or deliberately ignored it. Locking them out of their account and personal attacks were wrong, but those were ultimately actions taken by a relatively small number of users.

If people actually care about what Trans people have to say about the whole affair, then I'd recommend the Stephanie Sterling video on it."
"Agreed. I saw what they did during the stream and they showed their true colors. It’s more important for them to chase clout and get pity, hiding behind fake ally ship. Did they really call themselves journalists? If so, ridiculous.
While there was plenty of awful ugly things said, that whole community has silenced any dissent from the couple on down. So while I watched them, honestly starting like the couple of months after they launched, I’ve completely stopped following them after this utter fiasco."
"> Like this video is getting xposted across Reddit with every sub acting like it’s a crime against humanity.

Because these people aren't actually watching the video. They're just running to the comment sections in order to spread transphobia. It's just typical transphobic outrage.

Biggest proof of this? Absolutely NOBODY is talking about the anti-Semitic points of the game they brought up."
">	Like it just seems like a chance to dunk on SJWs while the typical alt-right driven hate mob gets a free pass because it’s expected.

Brigadier here, here’s my perspective: the issue is more so that people would like to enjoy their products without facing the consequences behind it. “I deal with enough shit, I don’t want to get shit for wanting to fly on a broom.” You feel me?

So if you can villainize the people who are forcing you to understand those consequences, you can more easily compartmentalize what you’re doing by buying Harry Potter

I haven’t bought the game nor do I hold these views, but that’s the vibe I’ve gotten from friends who’ve bought the game and from the internet"
"they literally use the ""iPhone bad"" excuse as if cellphones aren't required for a lot of peoples jobs"
"Yeah I will admit I'm not entirely comfortable with abuse being framed as ""consequences to your actions"" because abuse sucks and it is a choice of people to respond with abuse, but from what they showed on the video, it looked pretty tame."
"I bought it. I feel guilty. I’ll do better in the future. 

That being said, game is very average. Lots of quest lines are “Go talk to X,” then X tells you to go to location Y, then you go to location Y and fight either a goblin, dark wizard, or spider, then return to person X to complete the quest. The graphics are fine, not groundbreaking, but not horrible. Lots of magical stuff going on in the background which makes it pretty atmospheric. Combat is garbage unless you’re trying to look cool. It’s stupid easy even on max difficulty. The story is boring. There’s a big bad guy and you, the main character, are the most special and talented person in the world according to every single NPC. Characters are forgettable at best, nothing really interesting, just generic student types. Music is average, no complaints, but I’ve heard better from indie studios. There are hundreds of filler collectibles and a lot of the game is based on finding them.

I don’t know how a non-HP fan could enjoy this game."
"Calling the game an aggressively mediocre collection of antisemitic tropes and using it to call out JK and fundraise for a trans charity?

Might prevent purchases by people who didn't even know there was a boycott. 

If the only people streaming it are alt-right or aggressively opposed to the boycott? Then that creates an unchallenged lie for the audience interested in the game. Right now, lots of people are hearing this game is awesome, in reviews setting new records for lowered standards and hypocrisy. 

And the worst people in the world, are hoping that they can turn this into an ""allies betrayed by people they supported, because they were not perfect"" story...despite Shelby making it clear the poison doesn't represent the majority of responses. 

Just think about the harm attacking them is doing, right now as we speak, before calling them out for doing possible harm."
cause it reframes the narrative around behavior away from people way too comfortable with buying the terf queens game and over to how those crazy sjw's are at it again attacking histories most oppressed minority; gamers.
"The video is basically:
I know Rowling is a transphobe and that the game contains antisemitism and I still streamed it but I definetely don't support it.
I'm not a transphobe because i donated other people's money to the Trevor project ~~for a tax writeoff~~ to show I'm an ally.
I'm jewish."
Exactly! They don't seem to be aware that they've lost a chunk of their audience and instead are turning back to...the people that were dunking on them barely two years ago? I'm confused? This is all worth it for Harry Potter game ig
Gamers are the most oppressed minority in history donchaknow

Although, from what I've heard, some of the hate was because they were supporting the Trevor project, and not the game itself."

"And Twitch streamers and social media accounts. Thankfully the only Twitch streamer I've unsubbed from this is Keffals. But I would have done that anyways because she's an absolute piece of shit that tells queer people they aren't queer if they report her to Twitter, then calls them the r-slur in retaliation because they're disabled."
"I'm not wholly convinced there weren't some ding-dongs from this sub who, to borrow an SRD phrase, pissed in the popcorn. You get a community large enough, and there are gonna be some members of that community who have to ruin things for everyone, even if only by law of averages. And it's not like it was hard to figure out which sub was tied to the streamers who the sub was named for. Add in people who already didn't like these guys from *other* shitstorms in the past, and it probably wasn't hard to rally enough idiots to flood the reports.

All that being said, this video just felt like making excuses to my mind. I really enjoyed their stuff before, but you know, when someone shows you who they really are...."
"If you repeat a lie often enough it becomes the truth.

It's used by people looking to attack a person/place/concept.  Basic first principle propaganda.  

My kid's mom went around town telling people I fucked a baby.  Even printed up fliers and put in mailboxes.  Different versions of the lie, even told people that's what she was doing (""destroying"" me).

People ate that shit up for years and years.  I'd be denied entrance to my kid's daycare, kicked out of the city pool, physically attacked at dance recitals, etc.

That's just one angry woman and it shows how effective the concept is.  Just pick something people want to believe for whatever reason and it's easy to manipulate them into being your attack dogs.

So someone on the internet wants to fuck with the sub and is pushing the lie.

Everything else that happens is like gravity."
"Because they’re fucking lying, I also never saw this sub calling for harassment and I’ve been coming here for years. It’s absurd how they’re just making shit up now."
"> evil mean transes

""Filthy, nasty transes! They stoles our precious Harry Potter vidya from us! *GOLLUM!* *GOLLUM!*"""
"What's dumb is they could've just made a video without streaming it.  Matt didn't like the game anyways and because they're getting a free copy, they literally would not have been contributing to JKR.  Their review would've been making fun of the game, calling it mediocre and pointing out her bigotry.  That's not promoting it.

But streaming it over and over, even just to show side quests, is promoting it.  

Then combined with how they handled the subreddit and Matt's dumb comment on stream, it's just so disappointing for a channel that leaned heavily to the left to begin with.

With just an ounce of more forethought and empathy, they would've kept being everyone's darlings.  The stream itself was wholly unnecessary, except for a bit extra $.  And after they saw there was backlash to it, they still could've pulled the stream, except for a bit of extra $."
What makes you think anyone here harassed people? Got any proof at all?
"/uj

Idk, to me leveraging the attention from something potentially problematic (the game) to raise money for a good cause (the Trevor Project) is the perfect example of rebutting its hatefulness.

Like the title of the stream and automod were spamming links to donate, and as they pointed out in the vid (and I've watched them for a while), they're long-time established allies of LGB (and yes) T games, gamers, and portrayals in games.

I had heard rumors about the bullying stuff, but when I started their video today I was surprised to find out GFR was the/one of the impacted streamers, because I'm like ""wait, they've been vocally pro-LGBT in the past, what?"""
"As an American I chose to view this metaphor as describing an act that you didn't have to do, was entirely your own fault, and ultimately would be a loss for you. Which is very fitting tbh."
"As a Vietnamese second generation son of displaced immigrants from the war, these people need to grow the fuck up and realize what they are doing is wrong, and realize that their silly ass victimization is pathetic and misplaced."
"Do you remember Tati, and her causing drama doubled her subs.  Whenever a big youtuber/twitcher makes some dramatic claims, my spider senses go of immediately. 

While no one deserve harassment, both the big vtuber and gfreview, get nasty comments on a daily basis. I mostly think, why not bring that up all the time then."
"They mentioned those ""I'm disappointed"" messages as being fine, but she did spend the rest of the video was about real harassment and her just kind of asserting that she's in the right to play it, since she got a review code, and she is a game journalist, which, I can't refute, that's fair.

But she could have played a different wizard game on stream for the Trevor Project charity money, the publicity of the game as well as to a viewer that didn't show up to the stream from the very start, lead to a lot of ""I'm disappointed in you"", so in the video it's mostly just harassment instead of possibly clearing that up, because the generalisation of the protest about the game has been the minor bad faith actors which the media focuses on so that entire video was just about how harrassment bad, which, yes.

Additionally, there's no enditement of actual transphobes beyond a little portion near the start of the video, which is why the game has become such a shitshow. Even in that video's comments it's disgusting. But no, the left who have an issue with the game warrant the main focus of the video because just some of them happened to be terrible, and their behaviour isn't even reciprocated by the rest of us, like the downvoted or deleted posts from GCJ they used as evidence.

It's a bad video, but just a bit more time to cover Matt and Shelby's thought process fully about it instead of a 4:30 video would have felt less hollow, though I wonder if that was intentional instead of grappling with those more reasonable comments. I'm not them, so I can't really say."

"It feels a bit calculated, to be honest. 
Outrage and conflict gets you noticed which directly translates to money for youtubers/streamers.
They both know that because that is their job.

Stream the highly controversial game, try to cover your ass in every direction possible but pamper your core audience.
If there is outrage make a video which enforces the outrage but also keeps you on the positive side as much as possible.

Try to control the narrative by victimizing yourself.
They should go into (american) politics."
"Wait so they agree with all the critisism of the game but then do a 180 to say ""don't be mad, it's okay we promote this!"" Seriously FUCK these people. 

If you know it's wrong and you still do it, it's not a mistake it's a conscious choice to be evil."
You criticize capitalism yet you participate in it 🤓
"I think they are more upset about trolls brigading their sub and getting both their reddit accounts banned. At the start of the video, she clarifies that she wasn't crying and the clip of her getting a bit upset was taken out of context and way overblown to make her look like more of a victim than she was or percieved herself to be. Though the thumbnail and the part about ""I was more scared than when the TLOU 2 haters attatcked"" was pretty eyerolling. Plus knowing their sub took down a trans woman's open letter makes them look really bad."
"Yeah, I genuinely hate the ""but other bad things exist, therefore I have an excuse to ignore any morality!"" bullshit that's also been trotted out. One bad thing existing doesn't mean you should do *more*.

Additionally, there are a lot of other things out there to play and focus on if streaming video games is your career. On top of that, simply being informed of the issues with the game or being asked why you're still playing it after being informed of those is not harassment. 

Lying about people bullying you and overreacting in order to make them look like the bad guys is closer to actual harassment since it motivates people who already hate them and are likely to resort to violence or harassment to strike out at them.  


\- - - - - - - - - -  


It's just really bizarre how some supposed ""allies"" of trans people decide that actually they'd rather side with the TERFs because they've been asked to just not buy or promote a game. Just the one, mind you.

They need to just have some integrity and ignore that one game. OR, admit they don't give a shit about trans people and carry on. But don't falsely play the victim in order to demonize actual allies and those just informing them of what's up."
"Nobody here is okay with bullying.

To be honest I have no idea why everyone seems to be blaming this subreddit so much for harassment streamers have been getting... I've never seen any threads here promoting harassment or targeting anyone"
To be fair the video calls out to that she didn’t cry and said that even if she did it shouldnt be News worthy

"The *funniest* comments are the ones with 100+ upvotes stating that this justifies not being a trans allie and, in fact, means hate towards trans people is deserved.

"""We're disappointed you are supporting the game and I'm unsubscribing. You donating to an LGBTQ+ group doesn't make up for it.""

This is literally harassment. I'm a Jewish woman so I know what harassment is; literally the same as trans peoples' plight.

"They're not. Not only did they say alt-left, but they made the ""but what about iphones"" argument. That Matt guy is either a cryptofascist or a useful idiot for them."
"Oh no the ones I've seen are denying it outright and that anyone who sees any antisemitism in it are the *real racists*.

The tabletop gaming industry in particular has spent the last five years or so trying to distance themselves from the historically racially charged elements and depictions surrounding fantasy beings like dwarves, orcs and goblins. Some more successfully than others (Yes 'Wizards of the Coast' i'm looking at you).  

I'm old, and people doing the 'I can't see it, therefore *you* are racist for noticing it' just reminds me when people *swore* that[ 'Golliwogs had no racial connotations'.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golliwog)"

Not enough to stop giving her money it seems."
"I didn't mean that it was their user base but that it's the kind of users they are attracting. Go to the video, sort by new, see what kind of people are there in the comments. 

Maybe they should see to the kind of people that are ""supporting"" them and rethink their actions. There TERFs that were put off by the fact that their allies are literal fascists and started to wonder wether their fight was right. Like, obviously not everyone supporting GR is a fascists, there are very different people, but the fascists are on only one side so maybe the side is wrong. 
I mean, it's not even that this fascists like them, they are there just for clout and to fight against trans rights. You can even find people going ""oh damn, why did you say you are Jewish"""
"This is how I hate watch shows also, people who hate watch it by streaming on official channels just add to the problem 😂"
"There are always people who go too far, but I havent seen any of it because I'm only talking about this specific issue on here. I'm certainly not engaging with any of the losers who bought and streamed this game because thet've already shown that they aren't allies to the LGBT community. I imagine it's the same for most of us so where is the harrassment coming from?

They also need to remember that ""I'm unfollowing"" and ""I'm disappointed"" is not harrassment. ""You are not an ally"" or ""Your actions support J K Rowling"" is also not harrassment.

They need to try walking a day in a trans persons shoes and see what they get called online before they even pretend that they've been treated badly. If anything behaving like they are the victims only further proves the point that they arent allies as they dont know what it's like to be trans, or any kind of marginilised."
"i notice this shit everywhere. im not gonna say that no ally has ever done some questionable shit in the name of lgbt rights but false flag attacks are quite literally the easiest thing to do to hurt the image of faceless decentralized social movements and are everywhere at this point

any individual with anonymous social media accounts can make *anybody* an 'enemy' of the trans rights movement by spamming death threats at them claiming to be trans.

people need more internet literacy in general. when it comes to social issues that are not represented by a single unified voice it is utterly irresponsible to put any weight on random anonymous bullshit you receive in dms or chat. people make sweeping generalizations about the motivations of entire social movements without ever actually talking to a real person who is a part of that movement."
"I just rushed to this video and typed out “white tears.” because that’s all this is. Fuck Shelby and Fuck Matt.

I don't think they're bad and I like them, but I'm definitely not agreeing with them on this one"
"Liberals have long used as a bludgeon, this notion of trans people, ""alienating potential allies,"" simply because we are demanding human rights in their shitty, bigoted society. They want to pretend they are somehow better than fascists for trying to claim neutrality between bigots who want us forced out of society and dead, and us demanding the right to exist. 

We haven't lost allies. Those who collaborate with bigots who hate us were never allies, potential or otherwise. It is extremely pathetic that they are now trying to claim their intolerance of trans people is somehow an alliance with us. Bigots who are afraid to come out of the closet and try to hide their bigotry behind insincere kindness are more pathetic than the bigots who openly and proudly hate us. 

But they are no less bigoted. Arguably, they are even more bigoted. They place blame on victims while inviting open bigots to dine at their ""table for all."""
"dae think we should now hate all lgbt and jewish people because a few of them criticized a videogame? I mean they used to be tolerable and inclusiveness was super cool but after this sin, we should hate all of em, amirite guys?"
"no, at first she said the disappointed comments were fine, then proceeded to throw them in throughout the video like they were harassment."
I wouldn't mind if they actually apologized. In fact I would probably have stayed subscribed. But the way they wrote off all counter arguments as nonsensical. Tells me they aren't really sorry just annoyed they were criticized.
Nvm quick google search said author is openly homopohobic and stated he uses his money for anti lgbt propaganda.
"Also for the HL consumers, if there is drama around it latch on as much as possible and peddle it to the extreme to smear opposition. Criticism becomes harassment and is now worse than what trans people receive on the daily, claim that we’re as bad as gamer gaters, pretend like this subreddit never criticized “gamers” and made fun of people who criticized “gamers”, etc. And then have a decent amount of people from this subreddit fall for the claims that harassment happened when at best it was mild criticisms and use every opportunity they can to pin stuff that can not be coordinated to this subreddit especially when we’re not the only ones supporting this position anymore."
"And I forgot about the part where she said, ""As a Jewish woman, I feel it's my responsibility to investigate the antisemitic aspects of this game!"" Like aight, it doesn't take steaming the game itself to investigate the caricatures that are the hook-nosed, bank-owning, blood-libeling ~~Jews~~ goblins. But gotta get that viewership when it's hot, I guess."
"Not literally, that's the gimmick but it's obviously targeted at gamers themselves. It's honestly quite a good channel other than having a bad take in this case (ie. thinking that donating to charity is enough to offset promoting the game)."
um actually being asked to not pay $70 for a video game about a mid fantasy series that stopped being relevant a decade ago is a human rights violation
no. I saw the video and I don't think the couple did anything wrong really
I'm sure one of the most famous UK nationals in the world spending years and millions of dollars normalizing the dehumanizing of trans people and the removal of their rights has absolutely nothing to do with the sort of mindset that leads to the bullying and eventual murder of trans children
"Don't remind me, automod. Its just not the same anymore :(

"Yes, but have you considered that it would make them more money to pretend to be victims?"
"No, that sixty dollars is literally a few more bucks in an anti-trans organization's coffers. The harm here is explicitly monetary and material. That's the issue, don't take the eye off the ball. If JKR was spewing hate with no money, no one would give a shit either way; it is exactly the fact that she has money and spends it that makes her views so uniquely pernicious."
"The game has plenty of assist, especially on Easy mode. I am neither good with Rhythm or Hack n Slash game but I'm still able to S rank all bosses on Normal mode. All actions land on beat even if u button smash. I think you can also turn on auto combo, have all QTE sections set to 1 key only or have a big ass metronome on screen to stay on beat and all kinds of other assists"
"damn I must have missed that, I was sleep-deprived after all. Well then that's just plain shitty, the one good thing about the video that wasn't deflection or defending themselves was just reinserted back into their defenses while not even paying attention to those outside the bad actors. That's fucking disgusting. If they really think they're Allies, they're doing a terrible job."
"Agreed. I just happened to watch the portion because I was interested in seeing some of the so called abuse. I found it obv not cool but at its worst looked like a casual stream on the internet when you cover a polarizing topic. 

I think as others said they wanted it both ways. They wanted to appeal to people while doing something they knew would catch shit and they weren’t able to juggle that balance. 

It was dumb imo and they would have been better served playing a different game and making Both a Financial and moral stance with their massive fuckin platform."

"I honestly enjoy the way it looks but I’m a sucker for gothsploitation (read: that brief period in the late 90s early 2000s when all supernatural action movies were filled to the brim with alt.rock, too much leather and all exclusively took place in the grimiest locations you’ve ever seen. Think: Blade, Queen of the Damned, Underworld)."
Good. It's revenge against DMC being the most annoying thing imaginable.
"I wouldn't hate the games if I knew nothing about them. I know and have seen enough to warrant my dislike. 

Also, I enjoy anime. Just not cringe overdramatic shit like DMC."
Jesse what the absolute fuck are you blathering about
"being gay isn't something to be ashamed of. 

not liking devil may cry is."
Not sure what posting on No Nut November has to do with DMC?
Who is Rookwood and why did they curse Anne? Also who kills the teacher?
That's worst than the Mass effect 3 endings. At least I'd get different color explosions at the end.
If this is a big spoiler then the story must be ass
"One of the TERFs malded so much they replied to my comments in a completely different subreddit to tell me how angry they are about the spoilers

EDIT: holy shit they reported me as high risk- they must really care about the TERF school game"
"Damn, people be whipping out the forbidden spells.

Lel."
Can’t wait to see them terfs crawl into this comment section to cry and piss and shit and say slurs
"Why would you spoil a 12 hours long $70 open world game?? Man, think of the TERFs and idiots who bought it :("
"I don’t know why I’m mad you ruined it, I’m probably not gonna play it anyways"
I just don't care anymore. Shut the fuck up about Hogwarts Legacy
/uj as someone who hates HP this brought a smile to my face knowing the trolls coming to this sub and seeing this and getting upset over it lol
"Gonna put my two cents and get ass blasted here and god bless anyone who's playing Hogwarts legacy for the Hogwarts experience and is in this sub
I hate JK Rowling as the next person and honestly she should be erased from existence. But I think labeling anyone who plays the game a TERF is stupid. A lot of people probably wanted to experience something that they grew up with as a child even if said story was inherently really flawed. They wanna play in their favorite wizard world and for people to say they're TERFs cause theyre playing the wizard game is dumb and stupid. We should be making fun of the people who are buying the game to support transphobia not the people who wants to enjoy Harry Potter and only Harry Potter. And seeing y'all post a spoiler for the sake to piss of the TERFs? Like there's the small chance a legit enjoyer of this game seeing this and getting spoiled.
Donate to a trans charity or something idk"
That’s it? That’s the biggest spoiler? This game is ass 💀
Rookwood’s such a dick. If I recall he gets his ass beat by flitwick at the end of the last book
Gumbleshit gives snibbletwerp mindblowing head so he goes and kills jews for the glubbyshqrt guild or sometjing
I knew the teacher would die from the first 3 minutes in a review I watched.... that's the most obvious lazy writing I have ever seen
"Rocket becomes a raccoon at the end of GOTG 3. Groot and Drax die. Peter and Gamora don't end up together but still share a love that's hard to explain.

Spoil all TERF shit.  


Edit: James Gunn and Chris Pratt are transphobe bros. Chris actively supports a Hate Church and James actively supports Chris."
"Never had any interest in HP ever even though I grew up in the peak of the franchise, so this is the one time being hit with spoilers doesn’t suck."
"NEGATIVE OPINION ABOUT JK UP AHEAD CAUSE PEOPLE DON’T LIKE THOSE.  I WANT TO BE COURTEOUS AS TO AVOID THE BUTTS GETTING HURT CAUSE MEAN WORDS ABOUT JOKE SORRY JK MY BAD

It makes me happy when the people I don’t like are spoiled on things that are important to them :) if I called JK the nasty things the constantly calls trans people I’d hurt quite a lot of butts.  I do like calling her “rat fucker” though, it just feels good to say in regards to that TERF."
"bake snails many thumb bewildered outgoing obscene worthless unpack disgusted

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*"
I know Rookwood is the main villain. So him being responsible for the curse feels like a no-brainer. Next you’ll tell me that the Dark Lord Voldemort killed Harry’s parents.
I thought Snape was a good guy but everyone thought he was bad?
"/rj As an ally of all minorities and oppressed people, this spoiler has been the one thing that will now make me vote for all Neo-Nazi, fascist aligned white supremacist movements and do all I can to eradicate anyone who is not a part of that. I was a good ally until this point because this is too far!"
"/rj Transphobia literally kills people, but spoilers kill my enjoyment of mediocre corporate media."
"while it is still unproven whether or not a gamer can *like* two things at the same time, the theoretical limit for the number of things that a gamer can simultaneously *hate* is incalculable."
/uj Unironically fuck everyone who's actually having this reaction. Knowingly funneling money towards a transphobe who believes royalty checks are validation for her abhorrent views is so many levels worse than spoiling the mediocre ending of an objectively mid game.
But I had to spend 100 hours over a trilogy to get that ending that didn’t tell me what happened to any of the characters I built relationships with. I still hate it.
"those “endings” were so bad

Destroy is the only one that makes sense (which is why they stapled Shepard being alive to that ending) the other two is the dumb star child convincing Shepard to off themself in comical ways (touching a live current, walking into a giant laser beam) and showing a hallucination 

so bad"
"You were merely introduced to the spoilers. I was born in them, molded by them. By the time I heard ""Snape kills Dumbledore"" I was already a man."
"Lmao, I just got reported as high risk too!  


Feels better than clapping dad cheeks. Feels good as *fuck.* It's just them admitting they're seething."
"You can ""ruin"" story-heavy games with a couple lines as well, if you target the most surprising/important twists."
Bruce Willis is dead since the beginning of sixth sense.
"This entire game is lackluster from what I've seen, they forgot to put the game in this game cause most of the gameplay I've seen is 45% walking, 45% lifeless cutscenes, 5% exploration in an empty ass world and and 5% combat that looks stiff as fuck and dumbed down."
"Fight fire with fire my grandma used to say

You fund organizations that want to eliminate and kill me

I will spoil the ending to your children's book vibya game"
"A lot of trans people bought the game. I'd bet a fare portion of the people in this sub have it currently. But you know, outrage and whatever"

"it really is, I mean imagine clinging so hard onto a fictional series that is chock full of problems to the point you would rather play a game about antisemitism and fund transphobic legislation in the UK than just... not play it."
"You gonna get even more mad now? Pls write another essay, you're owning me so hard."
"Wha??? I don't really see how at all this hurts trans community. GNC communities shouldn't have to be docile and kind and fit into some 'acceptable trans/enby person' mold to appease cis people and terfs...

&#x200B;

When women wanted rights, they didn't get them by being nice and asking for it. Stonewall was not some peaceful happy campfire that got cops to leave gay bars alone.

&#x200B;

Segregation did not end by asking politely. Slavery didn't end because the slaves assimilated to anglo-european white colonial communities."
Sore losers? We won. Ruined the game for idiots like you who obsess over some mediocre children's literature. Lick balls forever!
I stupidly checked it. Talk about circle jerk. Ffs it doesn't even look that good.
"100, obviously not. But this game seems to have no change whatsoever. And make that statement quite funny."
It depends on how much time you are willing to waste writing every impact and programing it into the game
Sooo they lied about the choices mattering. Should have seen thar coming with the lack or a morality/karma system
"It’s also a really hackneyed plot. Like the plot is that AI and organics can’t coexist when literally the whole last  two games have proven that geth don’t want to destroy organics and they can actually coexist peacefully on the same planet. So you’re forced to accept a premise the game has spent two games telling you isn’t true in order to justify the ending nonsense.

Like gee how profound we need to destroy you so you don’t destroy yourselves even though you aren’t doing that

Like this is only a problem because you made it a problem, you as the AI destroying organics with the Reapers are the only one at fault of doing it"

I don’t hate the game, I think it looks fun, but I wont play it because I don’t want to support Rowling, even if the money doesn’t go to her directly."
wait I never considered you weren't an adult in this game?! That is kinda extra messed up considering some of the very adult shit this game is just gonna trivialize and dress up in kids game terms
"So you mean to tell me that the main antagonist they advertised, the pointy nosed beady-eyed stoop-backed money-grubbing goblin trying to destroy ""wizard"" society and kidnapping children isn't a thing?"
Here comes the both sides are bad train!  CHOO CHOO!
"It doesn’t. The OP is a fuckface looking for validation online. That this bullshit appears in r/all with a huge spoiler just gets them the attention their parents didn’t give them. Fuck this subreddit, the idiots who post here and the OP."
"Hey I'm kind of out of the loop on this and not trying to be an asshole, but how does this game directly fund anti trans legislation?"
"""I can excuse funding TERFS but I draw the line at showing spoilers for my wizard""

Like I give a fuck. People who consciously give money to people that are trying to eliminate my existence don't deserve to enjoy the story."
They’re such sore losers they can’t even keep their professor wizard alive in their fascizard game.

"I once got one of those because I refused to abandon a LARP in which I pretended I thought Peeves was a Graggle Simpson style meme that was never in the Harry Potter books. People kept correcting me and I kept acting like I thought they were doing the meme and got more and more performatively angry. 

No one was laughing, I seemed far too sincere, and I wasn’t even having fun. What was I even doing there? What were they doing that they were so invested in correcting me? This is barely related to your comment, why am I telling you?

Anyway congrats."
"Ah, yes. I remember the many years where I thought, “Of course I wish I’d been born a girl, but it’s not like I’m *transgender* or something! It’s very normal for men to think about this stuff… for five hours at a time while crying uncontrollably.”"
"Yeah, it's *ok.* Nothing about the game is great. Nothing about the game is horrible (except for the broom controls, goddamn those are bad. Right stick controls up and down movement and left and right *camera*, left stick controls left and right movement *but it is camera dependent*. It's a mess.)"
"This is the same cookie cutter response from all of you idiots but you completely ignore that shit like phones are completely neccessary in today's world. That's where ""no ethical consumption under capitalism"" comes in, because you don't have any choice except to support those industries. Buying the terf wizard game is NOT a necessity so you don't get to use that as an excuse."
"This has the same energy as a 90s/00s movie high school “bully” archetype who puts up emotional barriers and a “tough guy” facade but is actually incredibly, transparently insecure.

“You don’t know me! Nobody knows what I’ve been through!” 

But thinking 30 seconds of scrolling = “detective shit” is just about what I’d expect out of someone with the brain of a 16-year-old, so everything tracks."
I'm sorry the incredibly nuanced story of the greedy ~~jewish~~ goblin banker game was ruined for you.
"Yes, sure, I a nonbinary demiwoman am totally going to listen to someone claiming to be an ally and making false strawman about how 'telling people to not buy a game is evil and you are bad trans people and bad allies'"
"uj/ Snape was a bully to all the kids for like 90% of the books, and even killed Dumbledore, but then JK did a last minute rug pull that Snape killed him to save others and he was only mean to Harry cause he reminded him so much of Harry's mom whom he loved and Harry's dad whom he hated. He's neither a good nor bad guy, just an incel given more gravitas than he deserved."
"Holy shit JK Rowling funds anti trans legislation? What the fuck did I miss. Last I heard she was weirdly retconning hermione as a POC. 
What kind of dystopian clown world am I living in."
">and even killed Dumbledore,  

This is deceptive as fuck and does not belong on the list of reasons snape was bad.

1. Dumbledore was dying, had probably a month or two left at most.

2. Snape was one of very few who knew this.

3. Dumbledore trusted snape to handle his end of life care.

4. Snape killed dumbeldore to save Draco.  

5. Dumbledore himself approved of the action.

There is a lot of shittiness to snape, but being an asshole and bully doesn't make this particular action a bad one."
"Honestly friend, that seemed too wacky to be true. I googled it and sure enough, this shit actually happened. My cherished childhood memories are now thoroughly tainted with hate stank. I hate growing up."
"Yo what the fuck did I just read. Protecting kids is extremism? Must be from one of those “give us our guns” states.

Edit: ah fuck I’m dumb. I think I missed the sarcasm. My bad."
"/uj you unjerked before the post, so don't hide behind your shit to defend deceptive statements, you literally started the unjerk.

lol

Basically you unjerk in a circlejerk sub to make shitty opinions without being challenged, then write offended responses when someone calls you out.   get out of here man"
"I'm sorry to be the one to break it to you, genuinely. It did the same for me when I learned about it too- I grew up with this series and I hate that she's decided to go this route."
"I mean, they shouldn't be getting death threats at all. Should we be calling them out? Yeah, of course. But death threats, they'll just use as ammo to further villainize the Trans community."
Why are they getting death threats at all? It’s just a fucking game. Can we just move the fuck on?
"Fair argument, but death threats are NEVER acceptable. All it does is paint our community in an even worse light and make our fights even harder.

Seriously, some people, genuine or not, took it too far and now we have to deal with the consequences... again..."
"What about stopping sending people death threats because they played a game? Like, stop being a fking freak."
"I think it's very telling behavior for someone to make the logical leap of ""people on the Internet are saying that this action I am doing is harmful to trans people and Jewish people"" and for them to get upset about that and say ""fine well from now on I hate trans people and I hate Jewish people"" and I think it kind of communicates a sense that maybe they already kind of did, they were just waiting for a reason for it to be somebody else's fault."
"Yeah although with basically anything slightly 'controversial' or whatever, there will always be people who use it as an opportunity to send death threats, either out of an extremist viewpoint, being twisted enough to find it funny, trying to astroturf to make the group look bad or probably many other reasons.  


It's telling however that, despite this not being out of the ordinary (although no less horrific and unacceptable), people are still treating these people as the rule and not the exception and using it as a standpoint to villainise the entire group whereas for likely almost any other matter they'd argue that the death threats are coming from a minority of the backlash and so shouldn't reflect the group as a whole."
"That’s the problem with morality. Being right means that you must not only have the right opinion, but execute all actions pertaining to that opinion in morally correct ways as well. 

People who are immoral can use whatever tactics they want because they’ve no restrictions for themselves. Every time someone does a bad action despite having a good opinion hurts themselves by allowing the opponent to use that moment of immorality against the cause as a whole."
Good thing literally no one is threatening them. They are making shit up to otherize a vulnerable group
"You can’t exactly control everyone. Sure the case can be made when this sub or any other similar ones who decided to protest the game starts calling for mass harassment and death threats (they don’t since that’s against Reddit ToS), but if there’s any individual who wishes to do such things there’s no one to stop them because an online forum does not regulate every person’s actions. 

This sub and any other that’s involved does not condone dead threats, but that doesn’t stop a select few from doing it anyway. Of course, I can be disingenuous and say that maybe the death threats is unverifiable or it’s people outside stirring the pot, but the fact of the matter is that with these online “protests” death threats somehow always crop up no matter what you do. Although because a few individuals decided to be extra shitty does not mean that the wider group is invalid, the two can be taken separately."
"I agree with you. I'm just worried that the alt right will use things like that to fit their narrative. They'll have ""evidence"" that we are bullying them, and being cruel, and they ""just wanted to play a game, that's all!"" 

I'm more worried that they'll convince people who were on our side to begin with."
"Really? Because I spend all day on reddit in between work seshes and haven't seen it at all.

And if it's real report it then? The mods and community here are against violence as you can see in the comments here."
"The fucked up thing is several claims of death threats have been shown false already. Seems it doesn’t matter if folks do it or not. Also it seems so many forget the fash like to astroturf this shit, and send death threats themselves to frame X group."
"I already think that the concept of trying to desperately recapture childhood nostalgia is already kind of pitiful, but that's just my own saltiness from other franchises. This is just the latest. I think it costs zero dollars to just not play a video game and that there are no ramifications to not playing a video game. I think being able to sacrifice on something that you want is a normal adult human skill that most if not all well-adjusted people should be able to do.

if it was as simple as them just wanting to play a silly wizard game, then they could just do it on their own time and basically not put it out there for everyone. We knew that this game was going to be controversial back when it was first announced. Back when we first knew that anything was even being developed years ago. Common sense goes a long way and anybody who has any would've just played it quietly and kept it to themselves until things got quieter.

what does it for me is all the people playing dumb and pretending like they don't know why anybody would be upset at all in the first place. They know exactly why, they are just trying to simplify it down so they don't have to actually bear the burden of just not buying this one single game and letting this ip die."
"19 hours and absolutely nothing because there is none. I could care less what happens outside this sub but my “job” is to keep this community safe and follow Reddit ToS. If it had actually happened, you can best bet someone would’ve reported it and they would’ve been banned. But there was no such thing and people claiming that you can consider people with this talking point “it’s only happening on GCJ” shows how much they don’t care about what they claim we supposedly don’t care about and this is just another gamer crusade lol"
"I agree with you, but even if they advertise playing the game via social media or streaming, death threats are never okay. I understand that they are providing exposure for a game that is causing harm, but I feel like saying someone and their family should end up in body bags is a step over the line."
"See that's the thing that really throws me about these Disney/HP Adults. 

How have they not grown up to realize that they had shit taste in media as a kid and develop new and more complicated relationships with art? How can you as an adult, with your bare face hanging out, be this enamored with ""young adult"" material?"
"people talking big shit on the Internet has been a thing for years. That kind of thing is not going to go away at any point, it's just a lot of peoples first time experiencing it personally. Sometimes you just have to learn how to use your common sense and know when things deserve to actually be taken seriously."
"You have to keep in mind the foreign factor though, because the streamers I mentioned are based overseas, where this drama is less prevalent. On Japanese twitter most people aren’t talking about the game, so when they got backlash for playing it, it was seen as a surprise. Their western audience hated the fact that they were playing it, and their Japanese audience had no idea what was going on. Streamers over here should definitely expect controversy though, I agree with you on that."
